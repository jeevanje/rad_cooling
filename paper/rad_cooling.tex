\section{Construction of the model}
In this section we construct a spectrally resolved, analytical model for radiative cooling due to water vapor in an Earth-like atmosphere where water vapor is a condensable, minor constituent. The basic strategy will be to  simply parameterize $\kappa(k)$, the mass absorption coefficient ($\mathrm{m^2/kg}$) of water vapor as a function of wavenumber (or inverse wavelength) $k$, and use this parameterization to compute the optical depth $\tau_k$. This will give us the transmission function $\trans_k \equiv \exp(-\tau_k)$, which we can use to estimate the longwave flux divergence $\ppz \FLW_k$ via the cooling-to-space (CTS) approximation
	\beqn
		\ppz \FLW_k \approx \pi B_k \frac{d \trans_k}{dz} 
		%\quad\quad \quad \mbox{(cooling-to-space approx)}   
	\label{cts}
	\eeqn
where $B_k$ is the planck density with respect to wavenumber. Spectral integration of the above will then yield the total longwave radiative cooling $\ppz \FLW$, in $\mathrm{W/m^3}$.

To parametrize $\kappa(k)$ for \htwo, we begin with a plot of the minimum, maximum, median, and 25th and 75th percentile values of $\kappa$ for 10 \cminverse\ intervals, pulled from \cite{pierrehumbert2010} (hereafter \pierre). If we take the median values as representative of $\kappa(k)$ in a given 10 \cminverse\ interval, then the roughly
linear behavior of its logarithm suggests that we might parameterize $\ln(\kappa(k))$  to first order as a piecewise linear functions whose slopes and intercepts match those of the median curve in Fig. \ref{kappa_h2o}. This yields
\beqn
	\ln \kappa(k) = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
						\ln 10 + (\ln 10^{-5} -\ln 10)\frac{k-100}{1000-100} & 100 < k < 1000 \ \cminverse \\
							& \\
						\ln 10^{-5} + (\ln 1 -\ln 10^{-5})\frac{k-1000}{1500-1000} & 1000 < k < 1500 \ \cminverse \\
					\end{array} \right.								
\label{kappa_param}
\eeqn
Given $\kappa(k)$, the optical depth $\tau_k$ at height $z$ is given by 
	\beqn
		\tau_k = \int_z^\infty \kappa(k) \frac{p(z')}{p_0}S_k(T(z')) \rho_v\, dz'  
		\label{tau1}
	\eeqn
where $\rho_v$ is the density of water vapor and $p/p_0$ and $S_k(T)$ represent the effects of pressure and temperature scaling, respectively (\pierre). The reference pressure and temperature $p_0$ and $T_0$ are set to 100 hPa and 260 K as in \pierre, and the temperature scaling  is given by 
	\beqn
		S_k(T) =  \exp\left[-T_k^*\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_0}\right)\right]\; ,  \n
	\eeqn
	where $T_k^*$ may be estimated from Fig. 4.20 of \pierre\ as 
	\beqn
		T_k^* = \left\{ \begin{array}{lc}
							500 + 2000\frac{k-100}{1000-100} & 100 < k < 1000 \ \cminverse \\
								& \\
							2500 -2000\frac{k-1000}{1500-1000} & 1000 < k < 1500 \ \cminverse \\
						\end{array} \right.	\ .							
		\label{Tstar_param}
		\n
	\eeqn
		

As a first check on our approach we diagnose $\tau_k$ using Eqn. \eqnref{tau1} and output from an RCE simulation at surface temperature $\Ts=300$ K with \htwo\ as the only greenhouse gas .  We then use this to numerically compute the weight function $\ppz\trans_k$ via finite-difference, and then use \eqnref{cts} to compute the spectral flux divergence $\ppz \FLW_k$. Finally, we  compute the spectral cooling rate $\cool_k$ as 
	\beqn
		\cool_k  = \frac{\ppz \FLW_k}{\rho C_p} \; .   \label{cooling_eqn}
	\eeqn
This cooling is plotted in the left-hand panel of Figure \ref{cooling_fig}, and  may be compared to the line-by-line (LBL) calculation of \cite{huang2013}, reproduced in Figure \ref{lbl_cooling}. Apart from the absence of cooling in the  \cotwo\ band around 660 \cminverse, and the enhanced cooling in the water vapor window 800-1200 \cminverse due to continuum absorption, our approximate calculation is in decent qualitative and quantitative agreement with the LBL calculation. The main feature of both is  the diagonal band of cooling running from 
$(k,T) \approx (200\ \mathrm{K} ,200\ \cminverse) $ to $(k,T) \approx (280\ \mathrm{K},\ 600\  \cminverse)$. As is well-known \citep[e.g.][]{goldblatt2013}, this band represents cooling (at each $k$) where  $\tau_k\approx 1$ \citep[e.g.,][]{wallace2006}, and this level descends with increasing $k$ because $\kappa$ decreases with $k$, requiring a larger water vapor path (and hence a lower altitude) to reach $\tau_k=1$. The linearity of the band in $(k,T)$ space is due to the common exponential dependence of both $\kappa(k)$ and $\tau_k(T)$, as will be evident and further discussed below.

As a further, independent check we may numerically integrate our diagnosed $\ppz \FLW_k$ over $k$ space and compare the resulting $\ppz F$ profile to that output by the RRTM radiation scheme coupled to our RCE simulation. These profiles are shown in Figure
\ref{ppzf} in magenta and black, respectively. Our estimate of $\ppz \FLW$ is biased low in general; we speculate that this is due (in the lower troposphere) to our omission of continuum effects, and (in the far upper troposphere) our use of the median values for $\kappa$, which ignores the highest $\kappa$ values which are generating the cooling in that region. Nevertheless, our estimate captures the overall shape and magnitude of the benchmark RRTM curve reasonably well.

That the basic features of $\cool_k$  and $\ppz \FLW$ survive the approximations \eqnref{cts} and \eqnref{kappa_param} is heartening, but the expression \eqnref{tau1} for $\tau_k$ is still too complicated to be analytically tractable. We thus make several further simplifications.  First, since the integral in \eqnref{tau1} is dominated by values of the integrand close to $z$, we evaluate $p$ and $S_k(T)$ at $z$ and pull it out of the integral. This allows us to write $\tau_k$ in terms of the water vapor path $\WVP\equiv \int_z^\infty  \rho_v\, dz'$ as
	\beqn
		\tau_k =  \kappa(k) \frac{p}{p_0} S_k(T)\cdot \WVP \; .
	\label{tauWVP}
	\eeqn
We now need to estimate the water vapor path. We first write the vapor density as 
$\rho_v =  \RH\, p_v^*(T)/R_ vT$, where $p_v^* = p_v^\infty \exp(-L/R_vT)$ is the vapor pressure of water ($p_v^\infty = 2.5\times 10^{11} $ Pa) and all other symbols have their usual meaning. Assuming a constant  \RH,  $\rho_v$ is then a function of temperature only. This suggests that we also view \WVP\ as a function of temperature only, and we thus write it as 
	\beqn
		\WVP(T) =\frac{ \RH\, p_v^\infty}{R_v \gammaav}\int^T_{\Ttp} \frac{e^{-L/R_v T'}}{T'}\; dT' \; 
	\label{WVP1}
	\eeqn	
where we assume a constant, average lapse rate $\gammaav$ and we take the lower limit of our integral to be the tropopause temperature \Ttp (we neglect stratospheric water vapor). 

To evaluate the integral in \eqnref{WVP1}, we switch variables to $x\equiv L/R_v T$, which gives
	\beqn
		\int^T_{\Ttp} \frac{e^{-L/R_v T'}}{T'}\; dT' \ = \ \int_x^{x_\mathrm{tp}} \frac{e^{-x'}}{x'} dx' \ \approx\ \frac{1}{x_{\mathrm{av}}}\int_x^{x_\mathrm{tp}} e^{-x'} dx' \ \approx\ \frac{e^{-x}}{x_{\mathrm{av}}}.
		\label{int_approx}
	\eeqn
To make the first approximation above we note that $x$ varies between -18 and -27 as $T$ varies between, say, $\Ts=300$ K and $\Ttp \approx 200$ K, and so the exponential is varying much more than the factor of $1/x'$. We thus set the latter  to $x_{\mathrm{av}}\equiv L/R_v \Tav$ where $\Tav \equiv (\Ts + \Ttp)/2$, and pull it outside the integral. The last approximation follows from neglecting the boundary term $e^{-x_\mathrm{tp}}$. Plugging \eqnref{int_approx} into \eqnref{WVP1} yields
	\beqn
		\WVP(T) =\WVP_0\exp\left(-\frac{L}{R_vT}\right),\quad \mbox{where}\quad  \WVP_0 \equiv \frac{\RH\, p_v^\infty\, \Tav}{L\,\gammaav} \; .
	\label{WVP2}
	\eeqn
(The quantity $\WVP_0$ should be interpreted as a characteristic, though not necessarily realistic, value of \WVP, analogous to $p_v^\infty$ for $p_v^*$.)  As a  check, Figure \ref{wvp_check} plots \WVP\ diagnosed from our RCE simulation and estimated via \eqnref{WVP2}, with \RH\ set to 70\% for the latter by eyeball fit. The constant \RH\ assumption underestimates boundary layer \WVP, and neglect of the ice phase (and concomitant lower saturation vapor pressure) leads to a slight overestimate of WVP at upper levels, but otherwise the fit is decent.

We can now plug in our  expression for \WVP\ into \eqnref{tauWVP}. However, since \WVP\ is naturally a function of temperature, we should express $\tau_k$ as a function of temperature as well. This means writing $p$ as 
	\beqn
		p=\ps(T/\Ts)^{g/R_d\gammaav} \; ,
	\n
	\eeqn 
	which is the expression for $p(T)$ for an atmosphere with constant lapse rate $\gammaav$. Putting all this together yields an  analytical expression for $\tau_k$ in terms of elementary functions,
	\beqn
		\tau_k(T) = \kappa(k)\, S_k(T)\, \frac{\ps}{p_0}\left(\frac{T}{\Ts}\right)^{\frac{g}{R_d\Gamma}}\cdot \WVP_0\exp\left(-\frac{L}{R_v T}\right) \quad .
	\label{tau2}
	\eeqn
Though this expression is approximate, it contains no unobservable, tunable parameters. Let us check our approximations by comparing profiles of $\tau_k$ for various $k$ as computed from \eqnref{tau1} and \eqnref{tau2}; these are shown in solid and dashed lines respectively in Figure \ref{tauk}.
Though the biases in \WVP\ from Figure \ref{wvp_check} are certainly evident, the match between our analytical expression \eqnref{tau2} and the numerical calculation using \eqnref{tau1} is decent.


An analytical expression for the weight function  immediately follows from \eqnref{tau2} as 
	\beqn
		\ppz \trans_k = \left[\frac{g}{R_d T} + \frac{ \gammaav}{ T^2}\left(\frac{L}{R_v} + T_k^*\right) \right] \tau_k e^{-\tau_k}  \ .
	\label{weight}
	\eeqn
 The factor  in brackets is just $d \ln \tau_k/dz$,  an inverse scale height for $\tau_k$. Combining \eqnref{weight}  with the CTS approximation \eqnref{cts}  yields the cooling rate shown in the right panel of Figure \ref{cooling}, as well as the green profile in Fig. \ref{ppzf}.  Though many approximations have been made, we do not find  a major quantitative degradation relative to the cooling derived from \eqnref{tau1}, and the qualitative agreement with both the LBL (Fig. \ref{lbl_cooling}) and RRTM benchmarks is still good.

Now that we have some confidence that our approximations have retained the essential, spectrally-resolved physics,  we may derive an analytic expression for the total longwave cooling. This will require an analytic integration over $k$ space. We begin by noting that the $k$-dependence of $\ppz \trans_k$ is almost entirely through the function $\tau_k e^{-\tau_k}$ (the $k$-dependence of the scale height is weak, $\pm 10 \%$ of the mean over our $k$-range).  The function $\tau_k e^{-\tau_k}$(as a function of $\tau_k$) has an integral of 1 across $(0,\infty)$, with a peak at $\tau_k=1$, so we may approximate it as a Dirac delta function peaked at $\tau_k=1$. We can then switch variables to $k$, where $T$ is held fixed and the peak of $\tau_k e^{-\tau_k}$ is located where	$\tau_{k}(T)=1$. We denote this wavenumber as $k_1(T)$, which by  \eqnref{tau2} is given by 
	\beqn
		k_1(T) =  l_k\left\{\ \ln[ \WVP_0\kappa(0)] + \ln(\ps/p_0) + \frac{g}{R_d\,\Gamma}\ln(T/\Ts) - 
				\frac{L}{R_vT} - T_k^*(0)\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_0}\right)\  \right\} \; ,
	\label{k1}
	\eeqn
	where 
	\beqn
		l_k \equiv  \left|\frac{\partial \ln \tau_k}{\partial k}\right|\inverse= -\left[ \der{\ln \kappa}{k}+\der{T^*_k}{k}\left(\frac{1}{T}-\frac{1}{T_0}\right)\right]^{-1} \; .
	\n
	\eeqn
	We'll see in the next section that $l_k$ is related to the width of cooling band in Fig. \ref{cooling_fig}. It may be computed via \eqnref{kappa_param} and \eqnref{Tstar_param}, and is mildly dependent on $T$ ($\pm 10\%$ variations over the troposphere) but independent of $k$. 
	
	 We can now approximate $\tau_k e^{-\tau_k}$ as 
	\begin{align}
		\tau_k e^{-\tau_k} & \approx \delta(\tau_k- 1)  \n \\
					    & = \left|\partialderf{\tau_k}{k}(k_1)\right|\inverse\delta(k-k_1) \n  \\
					    & =  \left|\partialderf{\ln\tau_k}{k}(k_1)\right|\inverse\delta(k-k_1) \n  \\ 
					    & = l_k\,  \delta(k-k_1) \label{delta_approx}
	\end{align}
where the first equality is the standard chain rule for the delta function, the second equality follows from $\tau_{k_1}(T)=1$, and the third from our definition of  $l_k$.

We can now plug  \eqnref{delta_approx} into \eqnref{weight} and plug that into the  CTS approximation \eqnref{cts}. The $k$ integral is then trivial and yields the desired analytical expression for the longwave flux divergence $\ppz F$, 
	\beqn
		\ppz \FLW = \pi B_{k_1}(T)\left[\frac{g}{R_d T} + \frac{ \gammaav}{ T^2}\left(\frac{L}{R_v} + T_{k_1}^*\right) \right] l_k \; .
	\label{ppzf_eqn}
	\eeqn
This expression is plotted in blue in Fig. \ref{ppzf}. The agreement with previous more precise formulations, as well as the RRTM benchmark, is decent. Furthermore,  our procedure of incremental approximation and comparison suggests that this agreement is not coincidental, and that  \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} does capture the first-order physics of radiative cooling from water vapor. We can thus proceed to use it to gain insight into this basic atmospheric process.

\section{Basic properties of $\ppz \FLW$}
	\subsection{Heuristic interpretation of $\ppz F$} 
	Let us begin by interpreting the factors in \eqnref{ppzf_eqn}. To do this, note that with the CTS approximation \eqnref{cts} and the observation that cooling at a temperature $T$ occurs in a $k$-space interval $\Delta k$ around $k_1$, we can write \comment{add schematic equation here}
	\begin{align}
		\ppz \FLW & =  \pi B_{k_1}(T) \ppz \trans_{k_1} \Delta k \n \\
				 & =  \pi B_{k_1}(T) \ppz(\ln \tau_{k_1}) \, \tau_{k_1}e^{-\tau_{k_1}} \Delta k \; . 
					\label{ppzf_eqn_heur}
	\end{align}
As mentioned above, the logarithmic derivative $\ppz (\ln \tau_{k_1})$ factor is just the bracketed expression in \eqnref{ppzf_eqn}, representing an  inverse scale height for optical depth. The various terms in this expression (left to right in \eqnref{ppzf_eqn}) represent the influence of pressure broadening,  Clausius-Clapeyron (C-C) scaling, and temperature scaling, respectively. The factor $\tau_{k_1}e^{-\tau_{k_1}} \Delta k = \Delta k/e$ in Eqn. \eqnref{ppzf_eqn_heur} is just $l_k$, and a typical value of $l_k = 65$ \cminverse\ gives $\Delta k \approx 200\ \cminverse$, in good eyeball agreement with Fig. \ref{cooling_fig}.

	\subsection{Monotonicity of $\ppz F$}
Next let us ask why $\ppz F$ increases with $T$. From \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} we see that the inverse scale height  \emph{decreases}  as $T$ increases.  Furthermore, this effect is not necessarily reversed by the explicit $T$-dependence of $B_{k_1}(T)$. This can be seen in Figure \ref{ppzf_phase}, where we plot \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} but for arbitrary $k$ as well as $T$. The black dashed line is  $k_1(T)$ from \eqnref{k1}. One can see that $\ppz F$ increases with $T$ along  $k_1(T)$, but that if $k_1(T)$ were flatter (e.g. $k_{\mathrm{alt}}(T)$ in Fig. \eqnref{ppzf_phase}), then $\ppz F$ would no longer be monotonic in $T$ because the planck function is not monotonic in $k$. Such a conclusion should not change when continuum effects are included. Thus the monotonic increase of $\ppz F$ with $T$ is not an inalterable feature of radiative transfer, but rather an accident of water vapor spectroscopy.

	\subsection{Linearity of $k_1(T)$}
The linearity of  $k_1(T)$ in Fig. \ref{ppzf_phase} is striking, and also manifests in the linear cooling bands in Fig. \eqnref{cooling_fig}. What sets the slope $d k_1/dT$? And does its apparent constancy express some essential simplicity of the underlying physics, or is it just coincidence? A glance at our expression \eqnref{k1} for $k_1(T)$, which is a complicated combination of non-linear functions of $T$, suggests that its apparent  linearity is indeed coincidental. In fact,  dropping the $T_k^*(0)$ term as $T_k^*(0)$ is only 5\% of $L/R_v$, the derivative $d k_1/dT$ can be written
	\beqn
		\der{k_1}{T} = \frac{Ll_k}{R_v T^2}\left( 1 + \frac{gR_vT}{R_d \gammaav L} + \left|\der{T_k^*}{k}\right| \frac{k_1}{T} \right) \; .
	\label{dk1dt}
	\eeqn
Thus the order of magnitude of $\der{k_1}{T}$ is set by $Ll_k/R_vT^2 \approx 5\ \cminverse\ \Kinverse $, and its rough constancy ($\pm 10\%$ over the troposphere) is due to opposing tendencies between $Ll_k/R_vT^2$ (which decreases with increasing $T$) and the terms in parentheses in \eqnref{dk1dt} (which increase with increasing $T$).

\section{Temperature invariance of  $\ppz \FLW$} 
Our derivation of Eqn. \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} made heavy use of temperature coordinates, essentially because \rhov\ is most naturally a function of temperature, and it is the water vapor distribution which controls radiative cooling. Though some quantities in Eqn. \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} do have a pressure and/or surface temperature dependence, such as $k_1$ and $\gammaav$, the form of Eqn. \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} suggests that $\ppz F$ may, to a good approximation, be a function of $T$ alone. We check this in Fig. \ref{ppzf_tinv_theory}, where we plot profiles of $\ppz F$ derived from \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} for $\Ts=(280,290,300,310)$ K. with $T=T_s-\Gamma z$ for the left-most panel and $p=\ps(T/\Ts)^{(g/R_d\Gamma)}$ for the center panel. One can see that in temperature coordinates, the profiles of $\ppz F$ for various \Ts\ collapse almost perfectly onto a single curve. The same behavior is exhibited by the benchmark $\ppz F$ profiles generated via RRTM from four CRM simulations of RCE with the same set of \Ts, as shown in Figure \ref{ppzf_tinv_dam}. \comment{These have \cotwo\ though, and must be re-run without for production runs.}

The simple behavior of $\ppz F$ in temperature coordinates allows for a simple explanation of the result that column-integrated radiative cooling (and hence precipitation) changes at a rate of roughly 1-3\% \Kinverse\ with warming \citep{ogorman2012}. This result is known to be a result of radiative water-vapor feedbacks \citep{pendergrass2014}, but a back-of-the-envelope estimate has been lacking. To obtain this, we first note that the temperature invariance of radiative cooling still holds when extended to net (shortwave plus longwave cooling), as evident in Fig. \ref{ppzf_net}, which  shows free-tropospheric (i.e. above the lifting condensation level $\zlcl  \approx 500\ \mathrm{m}$) profiles of shortwave flux divergence  as well as net flux divergence $\ppz \Fnet$, as diagnosed by RRTM for our variable-SST RCE simulations. We can then write the net, column-integrated free-tropospheric radiative cooling $Q$ as 
	\beqn
		Q = \int_{\zlcl}^{\ztp} \partial_{z'} \Fnet dz'  = \int_{\Ttp}^{\Tlcl} \frac{\partial_{z'} \Fnet}{\Gamma} dT' \n
	\eeqn
where we no longer assume a vertically constant lapse rate $\Gamma$.  The fractional change in $Q$ with surface temperature evaluated  is then just
	\beqn
		\der{\ln Q}{\Ts}	\approx \der{\ln Q}{\Tlcl} = \frac{1}{Q} \left. \frac{\ppz \Fnet}{\Gamma}\right |_{\mathrm{LCL}}.   \n
	\eeqn
Evaluating this at $\Ts=300$ K with typical values $Q=100 \ \mathrm{W/m^2}$, $\ppz \Fnet(\Tlcl)=0.01 \ \mathrm{W/m^3}$, and $\Gamma(\Tlcl) = .005\ \mathrm{K/m}$ yields 2 \% \Kinverse, in excellent agreement with range of observed values reported in the literature. \comment{need to think about change in lapse rate too!}

There is a close connection between our CTS approximation for  $\ppz F$ in Eqn. \eqnref{ppzf_eqn} and outgoing longwave radiation (OLR), as the latter may be written without approximation as a surface term plus a cooling-to-space term:
	\begin{align}
		\OLR   & = \int \pi B_k(0)\exp(-\tau_k(0))\, dk \quad + \quad \int dk \int_0^\infty \pi B_k(\partial_{z} \trans_k ) \, dz \;    \n  \\
			   &  = \int \pi  B_k(\Ts)\exp(-\tau_k(\Ts))\, dk \quad + 
			   		\quad \int_{\Ttp}^{\Ts} \pi B_{k_1(T)}\left(\frac{L }{R_vT^{2}}+\frac{g}{R_d T} \right)\, \frac{l_k}{\Gamma}\, dT  	
				   \label{olr}
	\end{align}
where we switched from $z$ to $T$ coordinates in the second line. The local runaway greenhouse \citep{pierrehumbert1995} occurs when $\Ts$ is large enough that  much of the thermal infrared has $\tau_k(\Ts) \gg 1$ (e.g. Figs. \ref{cooling} and  \ref{lbl_cooling}) and so the surface contribution is small, and $\ppz F$ is a function of $T$ only, and thus both terms in \eqnref{olr} (and hence the \OLR\ itself) are insensitive to changes in \Ts. To what degree is such a local runaway evident in our RCE simulations?

The left panel of Figure \ref{fluxes} plots profiles of upwelling longwave $U$ generated by RRTM for our various-SST runs. An increase in \OLR\ is evident throughout this SST range, and for $\Ts< 300 $ K this is clearly due in large part to increasing surface emission. For $\Ts =300$ and 310 K, however,  $U(300\ \mathrm{K})$ is virtually identical, so it is not the surface term that is producing the additional \OLR in the $\Ts > 300 $ K regime. (Note that this is roughly consistent with the results of \cite{goldblatt2013}, who find that surface emission becomes irrelevant for $\Ts >310$ K.)   Thus, it must be the 2nd term in \eqnref{olr} producing the additional OLR . But, we don't expect the $\Ts$ in the upper limit of the integral to contribute as emission from layers warmer than $300$ K or so do not seem to contribute to $U$ at lower temperatures, and Fig. \ref{ppzf_tinv_theory}
shows that the integrand itself is a fixed function of temperature, at least so far as the lapse rate $\Gamma$ is held fixed. This suggests that the increase in \OLR\ is due to changes in $\Gamma$, which decreases by roughly 1 K/km throughout the troposphere between the $\Ts = 300$ and 310 K runs (Fig. \ref{lapse_rates}).

To test the hypothesis that changes in $\Gamma$ are responsible for the increase in $F(T)$ and hence OLR between these runs, we construct two profiles of $F$ for  $\Ts=300$ K using Eqns. \eqnref{flux}, \eqnref{tau2}, and \eqnref{ppzf_eqn}, where the only difference in the two profiles are the values of $\Gamma$ used in the integral in \eqnref{flux} (we take these to be $\Gamma =5,\ 6$ K/km).
