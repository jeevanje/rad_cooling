Dear Editors,

This work seeks to explain the well-known but not very well understood fact that climate models robustly predict an increase of global mean precipitation by about 2-3% per degree of surface warming. We explain this by first employing the well-known  radiative constraint on precipitation, which is that condensation heating from rain must balance the column-integrated radiative cooling of the atmosphere. This reduces the precipitation problem to a radiation problem. We then demonstrate a heretofore undiscovered property of vertically-resolved radiative cooling profiles, which is that they are in some sense universal when plotted using temperature coordinates in the vertical. This leads to simple, predictive expressions for how column-integrated cooling and hence precipitation change with warming, and also provides insight into the 2-3% per K value exhibited by climate models.

This work provides basic insight into the grossest feature of hydrological climate change, and should thus be of broad interest across the Geoscience community. 

Sincerely,

Nadir Jeevanjee
