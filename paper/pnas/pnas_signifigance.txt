Global climate models robustly predict that global mean precipitation should increase at roughly 2-3 \% \Kinverse\, but the origin of these values is not well understood. Here we develop a simple theory to help explain these values. This theory suggests that global mean precipitation is closely tied to the depth of the atmosphere, when measured in temperature coordinates. When surface temperatures increase, this `temperature depth' of the atmosphere also increases, causing an increase in global mean precipitation.
