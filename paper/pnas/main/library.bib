abstract = {The regional response of climate models to small perturbations is shown to be highly dependent on the unperturbed simulation. an experiment in which CO2 concentrations are doubled and sea surface temperatures are enhanced by 2 K has been carried out with two general circulation models which differ considerably in their control climates. the resulting changes in tropical precipitation in each model simulation are related to the increase in atmospheric water vapour which leads to enhanced precipitation in the main regions of low-level atmospheric convergence. Since these regions of convergence occur in slightly different locations in the unperturbed simulations, the distribution of changes is also different. Differences in control simulations must be taken into account when comparing results from different models (for example, on doubling atmospheric CO2); otherwise unduly pessimistic conclusions may be reached concerning the consistency of model results. One may be able to make subjective allowance for the effect of known deficiencies in the unperturbed simulation on the model's response before using the simulated changes in, for example, impact studies. A detailed examination of one of the experiments reveals that the change in precipitation is limited by the heat balance of the atmosphere, and indicates the importance of treating accurately the radiative perturbation due to changes in water vapour. the magnitude of the model's response is shown to be consistent with that found in three-dimensional climate models which include a simple representation of the ocean.},

abstract = {Most atmospheric motions of different spatial scales and precipitation are closely related to phase transitions in clouds. The continuously increasing resolution of large-scale and mesoscale atmospheric models makes it feasible to treat the evolution of individual clouds. The explicit treatment of clouds requires the simulation of cloud microphysics. Two main approaches describing cloud microphysical properties and processes have been developed in the past four and a half decades: bulk microphysics parameterization and spectral (bin) microphysics (SBM). The development and utilization of both represent an important step forward in cloud modeling. This study presents a detailed survey of the physical basis and the applications of both bulk microphysics parameterization and SBM. The results obtained from simulations of a wide range of atmospheric phenomena, from tropical cyclones through Arctic clouds using these two approaches are compared. Advantages and disadvantages, as well as lines of future development for these methods are discussed.},

abstract = {Observations made during the TWP-ICE campaign are used to drive and evaluate thirteen cloud-resolving model simulations with periodic lateral boundary conditions. The simulations employ 2D and 3D dynamics, one- and two-moment microphysics, several variations on large-scale forcing, and the use of observationally derived aerosol properties to prognose droplet numbers. When domain means are averaged over a 6-day active monsoon period, all simulations reproduce observed surface precipitation rate but not its structural distribution. Simulated fractional areas covered by convective and stratiform rain are uncorrelated with one another, and are both variably overpredicted by up to a factor of ∼2. Stratiform area fractions are strongly anticorrelated with outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) but are negligibly correlated with ice water path (IWP), indicating that ice spatial distribution controls OLR more than mean IWP. Overpredictions of OLR tend to be accompanied by underpredictions of reflected shortwave radiation (RSR). When there are two simulations differing only in microphysics scheme or large-scale forcing, the one with smaller stratiform area tends to exhibit greater OLR and lesser RSR by similar amounts. After ∼10 days, simulations reach a suppressed monsoon period with a wide range of mean precipitable water vapor, attributable in part to varying overprediction of cloud-modulated radiative flux divergence compared with observationally derived values. Differences across the simulation ensemble arise from multiple sources, including dynamics, microphysics, and radiation treatments. Close agreement of spatial and temporal averages with observations may not be expected, but the wide spreads of predicted stratiform fraction and anticorrelated OLR indicate a need for more rigorous observation-based evaluation of the underlying micro- and macrophysical properties of convective and stratiform structures.},

abstract = {A large degree of uncertainty in global climate models (GCMs) can be attributed to the representation of clouds and how they interact with incoming solar and outgoing longwave radiation. In this study, the simulated total cloud fraction (CF), cloud water path (CWP), top of the atmosphere (TOA) radiation budgets and cloud radiative forcings (CRFs) from 28 CMIP5 AMIP models are evaluated and compared with multiple satellite observations from CERES, MODIS, ISCCP, CloudSat, and CALIPSO. The multimodel ensemble mean CF (57.6 {\%}) is, on average, underestimated by nearly 8 {\%} (between 65°N/S) when compared to CERES–MODIS (CM) and ISCCP results while an even larger negative bias (17.1 {\%}) exists compared to the CloudSat/CALIPSO results. CWP bias is similar in comparison to the CF results, with a negative bias of 16.1 gm−2 compared to CM. The model simulated and CERES EBAF observed TOA reflected SW and OLR fluxes on average differ by 1.8 and −0.9 Wm−2, respectively. The averaged SW, LW, and net CRFs from CERES EBAF are −50.1, 27.6, and −22.5 Wm−2, respectively, indicating a net cooling effect of clouds on the TOA radiation budget. The differences in SW and LW CRFs between observations and the multimodel ensemble means are only −1.3 and −1.6 Wm−2, respectively, resulting in a larger net cooling effect of 2.9 Wm−2 in the model simulations. A further investigation of cloud properties and CRFs reveals that the GCM biases in atmospheric upwelling (15°S–15°N) regimes are much less than in their downwelling (15°–45°N/S) counterparts over the oceans. Sensitivity studies have shown that the magnitude of SW cloud radiative cooling increases significantly with increasing CF at similar rates ({\~{}}−1.25 Wm−2 {\%}−1) in both regimes. The LW cloud radiative warming increases with increasing CF but is regime dependent, suggested by the different slopes over the upwelling and downwelling regimes (0.81 and 0.22 Wm−2 {\%}−1, respectively). Through a comprehensive error analysis, we found that CF is a primary modulator of warming (or cooling) in the atmosphere. The comparisons and statistical results from this study may provide helpful insight for improving GCM simulations of clouds and TOA radiation budgets in future versions of CMIP.},

@article{Chung2015,
abstract = {AbstractIn this study, radiative kernels are used to separate direct radiative forcing from radiative adjustments to that forcing to quantify the magnitude and intermodel spread of tropospheric and stratospheric adjustments in coupled ocean-atmosphere climate models. Radiative feedbacks are also quantified and separated from radiative forcing by assuming that feedbacks are a linear response to changes in global-mean surface temperature. The direct radiative forcing due to a quadrupling of CO2 is found to have an intermodel spread of {\~{}}3 W m-2. In contrast to previous studies, relatively small estimates of cloud adjustments are obtained, which are both positive and negative. This discrepancy is at least partially attributable to small, but non-negligible, global-mean surface warming in fixed sea surface temperature experiments, which aliases a surface-driven feedback response into estimates of the adjustments. This study suggests that correcting for the bias induced from this global mean surface warming offers a more accurate estimate of tropospheric adjustments. It is shown that the regional patterns in the tropospheric adjustments tend to oppose the radiative feedback. This compensation is closely tied to spatial inhomogeneities in the initial rate of surface warming, suggesting that a substantial part of the spatial variation in the estimated tropospheric adjustment is an artifact of the linear regression methodology. Even when assuming that the global-mean estimates of the tropospheric adjustments are valid, neglecting them introduces little uncertainty in estimates of the total forcing, feedback or effective climate sensitivity relative to the intermodel spread in these values.},

abstract = {Subtropical marine low cloud sensitivity to an idealized climate change is compared in six large-eddy simulation (LES) models as part of CGILS. July cloud cover is simulated at three locations over the subtropical northeast Pacific Ocean, which are typified by cold sea surface temperatures (SSTs) under well-mixed stratocumulus, cool SSTs under decoupled stratocumulus, and shallow cumulus clouds overlying warmer SSTs. The idealized climate change includes a uniform 2 K SST increase with corresponding moist-adiabatic warming aloft and subsidence changes, but no change in free-tropospheric relative humidity, surface wind speed, or CO2. For each case, realistic advective forcings and boundary conditions are generated for the control and perturbed states which each LES runs for 10 days into a quasi-steady state. For the control climate, the LESs correctly produce the expected cloud type at all three locations. With the perturbed forcings, all models simulate boundary-layer deepening due to reduced subsidence in the warmer climate, with less deepening at the warm-SST location due to regulation by precipitation. The models do not show a consistent response of liquid water path and albedo in the perturbed climate, though the majority predict cloud thickening (negative cloud feedback) at the cold-SST location and slight cloud thinning (positive cloud feedback) at the cool-SST and warm-SST locations. In perturbed climate simulations at the cold-SST location without the subsidence decrease, cloud albedo consistently decreases across the models. Thus, boundary-layer cloud feedback on climate change involves compensating thermodynamic and dynamic effects of warming and may interact with patterns of subsidence change.},

Because the GISS analysis combines available sea surface temperature records with meteorological station measurements, we test alternative choices for the ocean data, showing that global temperature change is sensitive to estimated temperature change in polar regions where observations are limited. We use simple 12 month (and n × 12) running means to improve the information content in our temperature graphs. Contrary to a popular misconception, the rate of warming has not declined.

abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity refers to the ultimate change in global mean temperature in response to a change in external forcing. Despite decades of research attempting to narrow uncertainties, equilibrium climate sensitivity estimates from climate models still span roughly 1.5 to 5 degrees Celsius for a doubling of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentration, precluding accurate projections of future climate. The spread arises largely from differences in the feedback from low clouds, for reasons not yet understood. Here we show that differences in the simulated strength of convective mixing between the lower and middle tropical troposphere explain about half of the variance in climate sensitivity estimated by 43 climate models. The apparent mechanism is that such mixing dehydrates the low-cloud layer at a rate that increases as the climate warms, and this rate of increase depends on the initial mixing strength, linking the mixing to cloud feedback. The mixing inferred from observations appears to be sufficiently strong to imply a climate sensitivity of more than 3 degrees for a doubling of carbon dioxide. This is significantly higher than the currently accepted lower bound of 1.5 degrees, thereby constraining model projections towards relatively severe future warming.},

abstract = {Shale gas is a new energy resource that has shifted the dominant paradigm on U.S. hydrocarbon resources. Some have argued that shale gas will play an important role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions by displacing coal used for electricity, serving as a moderate-carbon “bridge fuel.” Others have questioned whether methane emissions from shale gas extraction lead to higher greenhouse gas emissions overall. I argue that the main impact of shale gas on climate change is neither the reduced emissions from fuel substitution nor the greenhouse gas footprint of natural gas itself, but rather the competition between abundant, low-cost gas and low-carbon technologies, including renewables and carbon capture and storage. This might be remedied if the gas industry joins forces with environmental groups, providing a counterbalance to the coal lobby, and ultimately eliminating the conventional use of coal in the United States.},

abstract = {The author has reconsidered the question of the regulation of tropical sea surface temperature. This has been done in general terms through consideration of the tropical heat budget and in specific terms through consideration of an idealized radiative-dynamic model of the tropical general circulation. It is argued that evaporation on its own cannot provide an effective regulating mechanism. Clouds cannot serve as regulators unless there are substantial departures from the observed cancellation between cloud greenhouse and cloud albedo effects. In particular, it is shown that the prediction by Ramanathan and Collins of highly stable tropical climates is based on an inconsistent set of assumptions about the behavior of the atmospheric heat transports. When the heat transports are treated in a consistent manner, clouds are found to have little impact, and the tropical climate can be quite sensitive to radiative perturbations. It is found that the main determinant of tropical climate is the clear-sky water vapor greenhouse effect averaged over the entire Tropics. In the absence of dry ''radiator fins'' maintained by subsidence, the tropical temperature would tend to fall into a runaway greenhouse state that could be stabilized only by heat export io the extratropics. Some speculative results on sensitivity of the climate to perturbations are presented. Determination of the relative area of dry and subsiding versus moist and convecting regions of the Tropics, and of the degree of dryness of the subsiding regions, are identified as key unsolved problems concerning the tropical climate.},

Since then, scientists have attempted to reconstruct past climatic changes and to understand their physical basis. Two competing theories have been suggested to explain the sequence of glacial-interglacial epochs: either the variations of the Earth orbital elements, or the atmospheric composition in carbon dioxide. If the astronomical theory has been largely confirmed since the last 30 years, a physical modeling of the climatic processes at work is still in its infancy. Besides, the most recent results of palaeoclimatology are clearly demonstrating that, more than never, a synthesis of these two old hypotheses is needed. ?? 2010 Acad??mie des sciences.},

abstract = {Recent downward revisions in the climate response to rising CO2 levels, and opportunities for reducing non-CO2 climate warming, have both been cited as evidence that the case for reducing CO2 emissions is less urgent than previously thought. Evaluating the impact of delay is complicated by the fact that CO2 emissions accumulate over time, so what happens after they peak is as relevant for long-term warming as the size and timing of the peak itself. Previous discussions have focused on how the rate of reduction required to meet any given temperature target rises asymptotically the later the emissions peak. Here we focus on a complementary question: how fast is peak CO2-induced warming increasing while mitigation is delayed, assuming no increase in rates of reduction after the emissions peak? We show that this peak-committed warming is increasing at the same rate as cumulative CO2 emissions, about 2{\%} per year, much faster than observed warming, independent of the climate response.},

abstract = {Theoretical models are constructed with the aim of relating, explaining and predicting features of a radiatively active turbulent cloud layer over the sea and under a strong subsidence inversion. Both dry aerosol clouds (no phase change) and wet clouds (with a phase change and latent heat exchanges) are considered. For the wet cloud case an important element of the theory is the requirement that the wet-bulb potential temperature must increase upwards in the inversion. For both cases entrainment of the upper warm air is hypothesized to lie between upper and lower limits determined from the tur- bulent energy budget. The dry cloud case is solved for both steady state and transient results, with only the transient behaviour depending on the entrainment hypothesis. Only steady state solutions are presented for the more complex wet cloud case and these differ somewhat for the maximum and minimum entrain- ment limits. Observational data from Oakland, California are used for comparison with those steady state solutions, with results indicating the essential validity of the approach. Detailed comparisons, especially for determination of the most correct entrainment rate, are hampered both by inadequate measurement of the inversion properties and by uncertainties in the net radiation flux leaving the cloud top. Computations of the latter suggest that several presently used radiation models are still in serious disagreement, at least for application to downward flux under an inversion. It is suggested that the present theory provides a partial explanation of the origin of the trade wind inversion.},

From 2009 to 2014, projected rises in anthropogenic influences and solar irradiance will increase global surface temperature 0.15 0.03C, at a rate 50{\%} greater than predicted by IPCC. But as a result of declining solar activity in the subsequent five years, average temperature in 2019 is only 0.03 0.01C warmer than in 2014. This lack of overall warming is analogous to the period from 2002 to 2008 when decreasing solar irradiance also countered much of the anthropogenic warming.

Emphasis is placed on the vertical structure of the convection from the surface to cloud top (sometimes reaching 18-km altitude). This unique look at convection is not possible from other approaches such as ground-based or lower-altitude airborne scanning radars. The vertical motions from the radar measurements are derived using new relationships between radar reflectivity and hydrometeor fall speed.

The probability of a combination of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and deep tropospheric wind shear being associated with significant severe thunderstorms has been calculated for both areas. Probabilities of significant severe storms are higher for high CAPE and shear in Europe, but those large scale environmental conditions are experienced much more frequently in the US, so that the overall number of events is much higher in the US. Probabilities of significant storms are approximately constant for constant values of CAPE*Shear for each of the datasets. High values of 0-1??km wind shear and low lifted condensation levels are associated with higher probabilities that significant severe thunderstorms will be associated with significant tornadoes. A subset of the US data, taken from the southeastern US in the cool season, produces probabilities that are much closer to the European values than the overall US data. The environments also are closer to European values with relatively low CAPE and low lifted condensation levels. From the southeastern US data, it is shown that the probability of severe convection occurring with moderate values of CAPE*Shear is much higher in the cool season than in the warm season. It is suggested that the higher probabilities result from stronger synoptic forcing and stronger and more frequent boundaries to initiate convection.},

Ultimate recovery takes place on time scales of hundreds of thousands of years, a geologic longevity typically associated in public perceptions with nuclear waste.

Practically all conventional cumulus parameterizations assume s ? 1, at least implicitly, using the gridpoint values of the thermodynamic variables to define the thermal structure of the cloud environment. The proposed framework, called ‘‘unified parameterization,'' eliminates this assumption from the beginning, allowing a smooth transition to an explicit simulation of cloud-scale processes as the resolution increases. If clouds and the environment are horizontally homogeneous with a top-hat profile, as is widely assumed in the conventional parameterizations, it is shown that the s dependence of the eddy transport is through a simple quadratic function. Together with a properly chosen closure, the unified parameterization determines s for each realization of grid-scale processes. The parameterization can also provide a framework for including stochastic parameterization. The remaining issues include parameterization of the in-cloud eddy transport because of the inhomogeneous structure of clouds.},

The model utilizes the “bulk water” microphysical parameterization technique to represent the precipitation fields which are all assumed to follow exponential size distribution functions. Autoconversion concepts are used to parameterize the collision-coalescence and collision-aggregation processes. Accretion processes involving the various forms of liquid and solid hydrometeors are simulated in this model. The transformation of cloud ice to snow through autoconversion (aggregation) and Bergeron process and subsequent accretional growth or aggregation to form hail are simulated. Hail is also produced by various contact mechanisms and via probabilistic freezing of raindrops. Evaporation (sublimation) is considered for all precipitation particles outside the cloud. The melting of hail and snow are included in the model. Wet and dry growth of hail and shedding of rain from hail are simulated. The simulations show that the inclusion of snow has improved the realism of the results compared to a model without snow. The formation of virga from cloud anvils is now modeled. Addition of the snow field has resulted in the inclusion of more diverse and physically sound mechanisms for initiating the hail field, yielding greater potential for distinguishing dominant embryo types characteristically different from warm- and cold-based clouds.},

abstract = {Mock Walker cells driven by weak sea surface temperature (SST) forcing are studied using planetary-scale cloud system–resolving simulations and a simplified framework that represents convection with its linear response functions and parameterizes the large-scale flow based on the gravity wave equation. For sinusoidal SST forcings of the same amplitude, as the horizontal domain size increases, the mock Walker cells strengthen substantially and shorter vertical scales in the vertical velocity profile diminish. This is explained by the fact that temperature anomalies required to sustain a vertical velocity profile of given amplitude are stronger in cases of larger horizontal and smaller vertical scales. Such temperature anomalies become significant at planetary scales so that properly accounting for the horizontal momentum balance, including convective momentum transport (CMT), becomes necessary, while a weak temperature gradient approach that neglects horizontal momentum balance is no longer adequate. The downward advection component of the CMT in particular is important for capturing a number of features of the mock Walker cells. The extent of convective organization also affects the mock Walker cell through its effects on the sensitivities of convective heating and moistening to temperature and moisture anomalies. For strongly organized convection with deep inflows, these sensitivities are consistent with a layer mode of convective overturning, instead of the parcel mode as in unorganized convection, resulting in a weaker second baroclinic component in the mock Walker cells.},

abstract = {An idealized two-dimensional mock-Walker circulation in the tropical atmosphere forced by prescribed horizontal gradients in sea-surface temperature (SST) is discussed. This model problem includes feedbacks between cumulus convection and tropical large-scale circulations that have proved challenging for global climate models to predict accurately. Three-dimensional cloud-resolving model (CRM) simulations that explicitly simulate turbulent circulations within individual cloud systems across 4,096 and 1,024 km-wide Walker circulations are compared with a simple theoretical model, the Simplified Quasiequilibrium Tropical Circulation Model (SQTCM). This theoretical model combines the weak-temperature-gradient approximation with a unimodal truncation of tropospheric vertical structure coupled to highly simplified formulations of moist precipitating cumulus convection and its cloud-radiative feedbacks. The rainfall, cloud and humidity distribution, circulation strength, energy fluxes and scaling properties are compared between the models. The CRM-simulated horizontal distribution of rainfall and energy fluxes are adequately predicted by the SQTCM. However, the humidity distribution (drier subsidence regions and high-humidity boundary layers in the CRM), vertical structure and domain-size scaling of the circulation differ significantly between the models. For the SQTCM, the concept of gross moist stability related to advection of moist static energy (MSE) out of tropospheric columns by the mean divergent circulation is used to explain the width and intensity of the rainy region. Column MSE budgets averaged across the ascent branch of the simulated Walker circulation provide similar insight into the cloud-resolving simulations after consideration of the more complex horizontal and vertical circulation structure and the role of transient eddies. A nondimensional ascent-region moist stability ratio $\alpha$, analogous to the SQTCM gross moist stability, is developed. One term of $\alpha$ is related to the vertical profiles of ascent-region mean vertical motion and ascent-region edge MSE; a second term is proportional to eddy export from the ascent region. Smaller $\alpha$ induces a narrower, rainier ascent region. The sensitivity of the SQTCM and CRM to a uniform 2 K increase in SST is compared, and the rainy upward branch of the circulation narrows in both models. MSE budget arguments are used to explain this behavior. In the simple model, the gross moist stability is a decreasing function of tropospheric temperature. Hence gross moist stability reduces and the ascent region narrows as the SST increases. In the CRM, increased atmospheric radiative cooling due to the warmer and moister troposphere destabilizes the MSE profile and decreases $\alpha$, inducing a narrower ascent region. In the CRM, and to a lesser extent in the SQTCM, intensified shortwave cloud forcing in the warmer climate causes a negative radiative feedback on the SST change.},

The role of cold pools, which occur due to the evaporation of rainfall, is explored using a series of experiments in which their formation is suppressed. A positive feedback occurs: the presence of cold pools promotes deeper, wider, and more buoyant clouds with higher precipitation rates, which in turn lead to stronger cold pools. To assess the influence of the subcloud layer on the development of deep convection, the coupling between the cloud layer and the subcloud layer is explored using Lagrangian particle trajectories. As shown in previous studies, particles that enter clouds have properties that deviate significantly from the mean state. However, the differences between particles that enter shallow and deep clouds are remarkably small in the subcloud layer, and become larger in the cloud layer, indicating different entrainment rates.

Specifically, the System for Atmospheric Modeling is used to perform 3- D cloud system resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in a nonrotating framework, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea surface temperature (SST). We note that self-aggregation begins as a dry patch that expands, eventually forcing all the convection into a single clump. Thus, when examining the initiation of self-aggregation, we focus on processes that can amplify this initial dry patch. We introduce a novel method to quantify the magnitudes of the various feedbacks that control self-aggregation within the framework of the budget for the spatial variance of column-integrated frozen moist static energy. The absorption of shortwave radiation by atmospheric water vapor is found to be a key positive feedback in the evolution of aggregation. In addition, we find a positive wind speed-surface flux feedback whose role is to counteract a negative feedback due to the effect of air-sea enthalpy disequilibrium on surface fluxes. The longwave radiation feedback can be either positive or negative in the early and intermediate stages of aggregation; however, it is the dominant positive feedback that maintains the aggregated state once it develops. Importantly, the mechanisms that maintain the aggregate state are distinct from those that instigate the evolution of self-aggregation.},

The domain is periodic in x (the horizontal direction), with a width of 640 km, and extends from the ground to 26 km. The lower boundary is a fixed-temperature water-saturated surface. The model produces a temperature profile resembling the mean profile observed in the tropics. A number of integrations of several months' duration are described in this preliminary examination of the model's qualitative behavior. The model generates a Quasi-Biennial Oscillation (QBO)-like oscillation in the x-averaged winds with an apparent period of approximately 60 days. This oscillation extends into the troposphere and influences the convective organization. In order to avoid the associated large vertical wind shears, calculations are also performed in which the x-averaged winds are constrained to vanish. The convection then evolves into a pattern in which rain falls only within a small part of the domain. The moisture field appears to provide the memory that localizes the convection. If the vertical shears are fixed at a modest nonzero value, this localization is avoided. Comparing calculations with surface temperatures of 25 and 30 C, the planetary albedo is found to decrease with increasing temperature, primarily due to a reduction in low-level cloudiness.},

The convection self-aggregates within 10 days into quasi-stationary mesoscale patches of dry, subsiding and moist, rainy air columns. The patches ultimately merge into a single intensely convecting moist patch surrounded by a broad region of very dry subsiding air. The self-aggregation is analyzed as an instability of a horizontally homogeneous convecting atmosphere driven by convection–water vapor–radiation feedbacks that systematically dry the drier air columns and moisten the moister air columns.

abstract = {This study compares the simulation of tropical convection in the National Center for Atmospheric Research Community Climate Model, version 3 (CCM3), using the original and a revised convective parameterization closure in the Zhang-McFarlane scheme. The revised closure couples convection to the large-scale forcing in the free troposphere instead of to the convective available potential energy in the atmosphere as employed in the original closure. In addition, a relative humidity threshold is used for convection trigger. It is shown that the mean precipitation distribution in the tropical regions for both summer and winter is, in general, improved when the new closure is used. During June, July, and August the precipitation in the western Pacific monsoon region is significantly enhanced, alleviating the negative precipitation bias there in the model. The spurious precipitation in the Arabian Peninsula desert is completely eliminated. During December, January, and February the South Pacific Convergence Zone is enhanced considerably. All these changes are desirable in addressing important model deficiencies. The probability distributions of the precipitation intensity from the model simulations are compared with that from the Tropical Rainfall Measurement Mission (TRMM) data. It is shown that over 90{\&}percnt; of the CCM3 precipitation is from light rain with rainfall rate less than 1 mm h ?1, whereas the simulation with the new closure and the TRMM observations show significant contribution (3040{\&}percnt;) from rainfall rates greater than 2 mm h ?1. Precipitation simulation over the western North Pacific summer monsoon region and the Arabian Peninsula was examined in detail to understand the causes of the precipitation biases in CCM3 over these regions. It is demonstrated that the convective available potential energy (CAPE)-based closure limits the CAPE buildup at the beginning of the monsoon season, resulting in the under simulation of the western North Pacific monsoon precipitation. In the Arabian Peninsula the positive feedback between convection and surface evaporation leads to the spurious heavy precipitation center there. In addition to the new closure the use of relative humidity threshold is also found to be important to the improvement of the simulation.},

abstract = {A simplified cumulus parameterization scheme, suitable for use in GCMs, is presented. This parameterization is based on a plume ensemble concept similar to that originally proposed by Arakawa and Schubert (1974). However, it employs three assumptions which significantly simplify the formulation and implementation of the scheme. It is assumed that an ensemble of convective‐scale updrafts with associated saturated downdrafts may exist when the atmosphere is locally conditionally unstable in the lower troposphere. However, the updraft ensemble is comprised only of those plumes which are sufficiently buoyant to penetrate through this unstable layer. It is assumed that all such plumes have the same upward mass flux at the base of the convective layer. The third assumption is that moist convection, which occurs only when there is convective available potential energy (CAPE) for reversible ascent of an undiluted parcel from the sub‐cloud layer, acts to remove CAPE at an exponential rate with a specified adjustment time scale. The performance of the scheme and its sensitivity to choices of disposable parameters is illustrated by presenting results from a series of idealized single‐column model tests. These tests demonstrate that the scheme permits establishment of a quasi‐equilibrium between large‐scale forcing and convective response. However, it is also shown that the strength of convective downdrafts is an important factor in determining the nature of the equilibrium state. Relatively strong down‐drafts give rise to an unsteady irregularly fluctuating state characterized by alternate periods of deep and shallow convection. The effect of using the scheme for GCM climate simulations is illustrated by presenting selected results of a multi‐year simulation carried out with the Canadian Climate Centre GCM using the new parameterization (the CONV simulation). Comparison of these results with those for a climate simulation made with the standard model (the CONTROL simulation, as documented by McFarlane et al., 1992) reveals the importance of other parameterized processes in determining the ultimate effect of introducing the new convective scheme. The radiative response to changes in the cloudiness regime is particularly important in this regard.},

abstract = {This study investigates the effect of entrainment dilution on convective available potential energy (CAPE) and closure assumptions in convection parameterization using the sounding data from three Intensive Observation Periods (IOPs). It is shown that entrainment of the environmental air has a strong dilution effect on CAPE, and this effect depends on the degree of subsaturation of the entrained air: the drier the entrained air, the larger the effect. For CAPE-based closure assumptions, the dilute CAPE has a moderate correlation with convective removal of CAPE. While better than for undiluted CAPE, which is virtually uncorrelated with convective CAPE removal, this correlation is not satisfactory enough for convection closure. For quasi-equilibrium–based closures, while the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium assumption is a superior closure for convection when undiluted CAPE is used, both the Arakawa-Schubert quasi-equilibrium closure and the free tropospheric quasi-equilibrium closure work well for dilute CAPE in all three IOPs studied. It is further shown from the CAPE definition and the large-scale temperature budget equation that for undiluted CAPE, the free tropospheric large-scale CAPE change and precipitation are approximately linearly related. The most important effect of entrainment dilution on CAPE and convection parameterization closure assumptions is to enhance the role of free tropospheric humidity, thereby diminishing the overwhelming role of boundary layer control on undiluted CAPE and its variation.},

abstract = {A global archive of high-resolution (3-hourly, 0.58 latitude–longitude grid) window (11–12 mm) brightness
temperature (Tb) data from multiple satellites is being developed by the European Union Cloud Archive User
Service (CLAUS) project. It has been used to construct a climatology of the diurnal cycle in convection,
cloudiness, and surface temperature for all regions of the Tropics. An example of the application of the climatology
to the evaluation of the climate version of the U.K. Met. Office Unified Model (UM), version HadAM3, is
presented.
The characteristics of the diurnal cycle described by the CLAUS data agree with previous observational
studies, demonstrating the universality of the characteristics of the diurnal cycle for land versus ocean, clear
sky versus convective regimes. It is shown that oceanic deep convection tends to reach its maximum in the
early morning. Continental convection generally peaks in the evening, although there are interesting regional
variations, indicative of the effects of complex land–sea and mountain–valley breezes, as well as the life cycle
of mesoscale convective systems. A striking result from the analysis of the CLAUS data has been the extent to
which the strong diurnal signal over land is spread out over the adjacent oceans, probably through gravity waves
of varying depths. These coherent signals can be seen for several hundred kilometers and in some instances,
such as over the Bay of Bengal, can lead to substantial diurnal variations in convection and precipitation.
The example of the use of the CLAUS data in the evaluation of the Met. Office UM has demonstrated that
the model has considerable difficulty in capturing the observed phase of the diurnal cycle in convection, which
suggests some fundamental difficulties in the model's physical parameterizations. Analysis of the diurnal cycle
represents a powerful tool for identifying and correcting model deficiencies.},

abstract = {The Community Atmosphere Model, version 4 (CAM4), was released as part of the Community Climate System Model, version 4 (CCSM4). The finite volume (FV) dynamical core is now the default because of its superior transport and conservation properties. Deep convection parameterization changes include a dilute plume calculation of convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the introduction of convective mo- mentum transport (CMT). An additional cloud fraction calculation is now performed following macro- physical state updates to provide improved thermodynamic consistency. A freeze-drying modification is further made to the cloud fraction calculation in very dry environments (e.g., the Arctic), where cloud fraction and cloud water values were often inconsistent in CAM3. In CAM4 the FV dynamical core further degrades the excessive trade-wind simulation, but reduces zonal stress errors at higher latitudes. Plume dilution alle- viates much of the midtropospheric tropical dry biases and reduces the persistent monsoon precipitation biases over the Arabian Peninsula and the southern Indian Ocean.CMTreduces much of the excessive trade- wind biases in eastern ocean basins. CAM4 shows a global reduction in cloud fraction compared to CAM3, primarily as a result of the freeze-drying and improved cloud fraction equilibrium modifications. Regional climate feature improvements include the propagation of stationary waves from the Pacific into midlatitudes and the seasonal frequency of Northern Hemisphere blocking events.A18 versus 28 horizontal resolution of the FV dynamical core exhibits superior improvements in regional climate features of precipitation and surface stress. Improvements in the fully coupled mean climate between CAM3 and CAM4 are also more substantial than in forced sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. 1.},

In radar rainfall data and the simulation with the Grell scheme, another weaker eastward propagating diurnal signal is evident from the Appalachians to the east coast.

abstract = {In the context of the European Cloud Systems project, the problem of the simulation of the diurnal cycle of convective precipitation over land is addressed with the aid of cloud-resolving (CRM) and single-column (SCM) model simulations of an idealized midlatitude case for which observations of large-scale and surface forcing are available. The CRM results are compared to different versions of the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) convection schemes using different convective trigger procedures and convective closures. In the CRM, maximum rainfall intensity occurs at 15 h (local time). In this idealized midlatitude case, most schemes do not reproduce the afternoon precipitation peak, as (i) they cannot reproduce the gradual growth (typically over 3 hours) of the deep convective cloud layer and (ii) they produce a diurnal cycle of precipitation that is in phase with the diurnal cycle of the convective available potential energy (CAPE) and the convective inhibition (CIN), consistent with the parcel theory and CAPE closure used in the bulk mass-flux scheme. The scheme that links the triggering to the large-scale vertical velocity gets the maximum precipitation at the right time, but this may be artificial as the vertical velocity is enforced in the single-column context.The study is then extended to the global scale using ensembles of 72-hour global forecasts at resolution T511 (40 km), and long-range single 40-day forecasts at resolution T 159 (125 km) with the ECMWF general-circulation model. The focus is on tropical South America and Africa where the diurnal cycle is most pronounced. The forecasts are evaluated against analyses and observed radiosonde data, as well as observed surface and satellite-derived rainfall rates. The ECMWF model version with improved convective trigger produces the smallest biases overall. It also shifts the rainfall maximum to 12 It compared to 9.5 h in the original version. In contrast to the SCM, the vertical-velocity-dependent trigger does not further improve the phase of the diurnal cycle. However. further work is necessary to match the observed 15 h precipitation peak.},

The study is based on measurements from 20 European stations for the period of 1972-2009. We also use the results of the Global Forecasting System (GFS) model to see how mentioned parameters behave in numerical models.Our research results indicate that CAPE is not a good measure of precipitation rate for all latitudes, although, in model results, CAPE and precipitation rate are found to be better correlated for middle latitudes then in higher latitudes and tropical regions. The best correlation with precipitation rate in middle latitudes is one with SF. Our results suggest that moisture is underestimated in numerical models for middle latitudes and encourage further work in including SF or similar parameter into precipitation parameterization in addition to the current one. {\textcopyright} 2013 Elsevier B.V.},

In this paper, the authors investigate the effects of grid resolution on convective processes using a nonhydrostatic cloud model to help clarify the capabilities and limitations of using explicit physics to resolve convection in mesoscale models. By varying the horizontal grid interval between 1 and 12 km, the degradation in model response as the resolution is decreased is documented and the processes that are not properly represented with the coarser resolutions are identified. Results from quasi-three-dimensional squall-line simulations for midlatitude-type environments suggest that resolutions of 4 km are sufficient to reproduce much of the mesoscale structure and evolution of the squall-line-type convective systems produced in 1-km simulations. The evolution at coarser resolutions is characteristically slow...},

abstract = {The radiation balance of the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) is examined using several different radiation codes with standard profiles compiled from observations in the tropics assuming clear sky conditions. These codes include detailed radiative transfer models and simplified codes for global climate models. The importance of the various radiatively active gases are examined. Water vapor is the most important contributor to the TTL radiation balance, but carbon dioxide and ozone also play a role. Differences in radiative heating between radiation models are mostly due to treatments of shortwave radiation. Differences between models below the TTL are due to different treatments of water vapor continuum absorption. The level of zero clear sky radiative heating, a level important for understanding the transport of air into the stratosphere, is generally found near 15 km, 125 hPa and 200K (360 K potential temperature), consistent with previous work. Changes in time and space can modify this level by +/-500 m, and individual profiles vary from these averages by +/-400 m (1$\sigma$). Increases in water vapor in the TTL would tend to increase the altitude of the level at which the net heating is zero, while increases in carbon dioxide or ozone would tend to decrease this level. Clouds in the TTL tend to increase the level due to enhancements in longwave cooling above clouds. The implications for transport are discussed.},

abstract = {This paper investigates the impacts of horizontal resolution on the statistical behavior of convection. An idealized radiative-convective equilibrium is simulated for model resolutions ranging between 2 and 50 km. The simulations are compared based upon the analysis of the mean state, the energy and water vapor transport, and the probability distribution functions for various quantities. It is shown that, at a coarse resolution, the model is unable to capture the mixing associated with shallow clouds. This results in a dry bias in the lower troposphere, and in an excessive amount of water clouds. Despite this deficiency, the coarse resolution simulations are able to reproduce reasonably well the statistical properties of deep convective towers. This is particularly apparent in the cloud ice and vertical velocity distributions that exhibit a very robust behavior. A theoretical scaling for the vertical velocity as function of the grid resolution is derived based upon the behavior of an idealized air bubble. It is shown that the vertical velocity of an ascending air parcel is determined by its aspect ratio, with a wide, flat parcel rising at a much slower pace than a narrow one. This theoretical scaling law exhibits a similar sensitivity to that of the numerical simulations. It is used to renormalize the probability distribution functions for vertical velocity, which show a very good agreement for resolutions up to 16 km. This new scaling law offers a way to improve direct simulations of deep convection in coarse resolution models.},

abstract = {The pressure is a somewhat mysterious quantity in incompressible flows. It is not a thermodynamic variable as there is no ‘equation of state' for an incompressible fluid. It is in one sense a mathematical artefact-a Lagrange multiplier that constrains the velocity field to remain divergence-free; i.e., incompressible-yet its gradient is a relevant physical quantity: a force per unit volume. It propagates at infinite speed in order to keep the flow always and everywhere incompressible; i.e., it is always in equilibrium with a time-varying divergence- free velocity field. It is also often difficult and/or expensive to compute. While the pressure is perfectly well- defined (at least up to an arbitrary additive constant) by the governing equations describing the conservation of mass and momentum, it is (ironically) less so when more directly expressed in terms of a Poisson equation that is both derivable from the original conservation equations and used (or misused) to replace the mass conservation equation. This is because in this latter form it is also necessary to address directly the subject of pressure boundary conditions, whose proper specification is crucial (in many ways) and forms the basis of this work. Herein we show that the same principles of mass and momentum conservation, combined with a continuity argument, lead to the correct boundary conditions for the pressure Poisson equation: viz., a Neumann condition that is derived simply by applying the normal component of the momentum equation at the boundary. It usually follows, but is not so crucial, that the tangential momentum equation is also satisfied at the boundary. KEY},

abstract = {Basic concepts of buoyancy are reviewed and considered first in light of simple parcel theory and then in a more complete form. It is shown that parcel theory is generally developed in terms of the density (temperature) difference between an ascending parcel and an “environment” surrounding that parcel. That is, buoyancy is often understood as a relative quantity that apparently depends on the choice of a base-state environmental profile. However, parcel theory is most appropriately understood as a probe of the static stability of a sounding to finite vertical displacements of hypothetical parcels within the sounding rather than as a useful model of deep convection.The thermal buoyancy force, as measured by the temperature difference between a parcel and the base state, and vertical perturbation pressure gradient force together must remain independent of the base state. The vertical perturbation pressure gradient force can be decomposed to include a term due to thermal buoyancy and another due to the properties of motion in the flow. Some thought experiments are presented to illustrate the ambiguous relevance of the base state.It is concluded that buoyancy is not a relative quantity in that it cannot be dependent on the choice of an essentially arbitrary reference state. Buoyancy is the static part of an unbalanced vertical pressure gradient force and, as such, is determined locally, not relative to some arbitrary base state outside of a parcel. This has direct application to the diagnosis of buoyancy from numerical simulations—done properly, such a diagnosis must include not only the thermal buoyancy term but also the perturbation pressure gradient force due to buoyancy.},

Consistent finite-difference approximations for the pressure equation with Neumann boundary conditions are developed to satisfy the compatibility condition on non-staggered grids.

A precipitation fallout scheme is devised that depends on water content, drop spectrum, and the vertical rise rate of the tower.

A hierarchy of seeding routines, using different ice collection efficiencies and terminal velocities, is partially tested against the data of the Stormfury 1965 tropical cumulus-seeding experiment.

In particular, parameterizations of the dry convective boundary layer, in spite of the absence of water phase-changes and its consequent simplicity as compared to moist convection, typically suffer from problems in attempting to represent realistically the boundary layer growth and what is often referred to as countergradient fluxes. The eddy-diffusivity (ED) approach has been relatively successful in representing some characteristics of neutral boundary layers and surface layers in general. The mass-flux (MF) approach, on the other hand, has been used for the parameterization of shallow and deep moist convection. In this paper, a new approach that relies on a combination of the ED and MF parameterizations (EDMF) is proposed for the dry convective boundary layer. It is shown that the EDMF approach follo...},

abstract = {The entropy budget has been a popular starting point for theories of the work, or dissipation, performed by moist atmospheres. For a dry atmosphere, the entropy budget provides a theory for the dissipation in terms of the imposed diabatic heat sources. For a moist atmosphere, the difficulties in quantifying irreversible moist processes or the value of the condensation temperature have so far frustrated efforts to construct a theory of dissipation. With this complication in mind, one of the goals here is to investigate the predictive power of the budget of dry entropy (i.e., the heat capacity times the logarithm of potential temperature). Toward this end, the dry-entropy budget is derived for an atmosphere with realistic heat capacities and a solid-water phase, features that were absent from some previous studies of atmospheric entropy. It is shown that the dry-entropy budget may be interpreted as the sum of sources and sinks from six processes, which are, in order of decreasing magnitude, radiative cooling, condensation heating, sensible heating at the surface, wind-generated frictional dissipation, lifting of water, and transport of heat from the melting line to the upper troposphere. This picture leads to an alternative explanation for the low efficiency of the moist atmospheric engine. Numerical simulations are presented from a new cloud-resolving model, Das Atmosph{\"{a}}rische Modell, which was designed to conserve energy and close the dry-entropy budget. Simulations with and without subgrid diffusion of heat and water are compared to investigate the impact of subgrid parameterizations on the terms in the dry-entropy budget. The numerical results suggest a particularly simple parameterization of wind-generated dissipation that appears to be valid for changes in sea surface temperature and mean wind. The dry-entropy budget also points to various changes in forcings and parameterizations that could be expected to increase or decrease the wind-generated dissipation.},

abstract = {As models of the Earth/atmosphere system and observations become ever more sophisticated, and concerns about climate change and societal impacts of extreme weather and its forecasting grow, understanding the role of clouds in the atmosphere is increasingly vital. Cloud Dynamics, Second Edition provides the essential information needed to understand how clouds affect climate and weather. This comprehensive book examines the underlying physics and dynamics of every specific type of cloud that occurs in the Earth's atmosphere, showing how clouds differ dynamically depending on whether they occur over oceans or mountains, or as parts of atmospheric storms, such as thunderstorms, tropical cyclones, or warm and cold fronts. Covering both the microphysical and macrophysical aspects of clouds, the book treats all of the physical scales involved in cloud processes, from the microscale of the individual drops and ice particles up to scales of storms in which the clouds occur.

abstract = {This book is a major revision of Numerical Methods for Wave Equations in Geophysical Fluid Dynamics; the new title of the second edition conveys its broader scope. The second edition is designed to serve graduate students and researchers studying geophysical fluids, while also providing a non-discipline-specific introduction to numerical methods for the solution of time-dependent differential equations. The methods considered are those at the foundation of real-world atmospheric or ocean models, with the focus being on the essential mathematical properties of each method. The fundamental character of each scheme is examined in prototypical fluid-dynamical problems like tracer transport, chemically reacting flow, shallow-water waves, and waves in an internally stratified fluid. The book includes exercises and is well illustrated with figures linking theoretical analyses to results from actual computations. Changes from the first edition include new chapters, discussions and updates throughout. From the reviews: '...The book's unquestionable advantage is the clarity and simplicity in presenting virtually all basic ideas and methods of numerical analysis currently actively used in geophysical fluid dynamics.'

abstract = {Abstract The present study introduces a parameterization for the mixing in the surface-generated free convection regime (including dry and moist convection cases). The parameterization explicitly represents the plumes that drive the convective turbulence. Ascending parcels that have similar properties in the surface layer are grouped into updrafts, with a determined fractional area. The updrafts ascend according to an entraining plume model, and may eventually overturn. The plume model can either use a time or a length scale for the lateral entrainment closure. The plumes' environment is assumed to be horizontally uniform. A one-dimensional framework is used to evaluate the parameterization in the case of a dry convective boundary layer (CBL). The predicted variances are underestimated (presumably due to the uniform environment assumption). The contrast between the strong upward motions and the compensating subsidence is simulated, and the skewness of w increases realistically with height. The plumes' dyn...},

We also consider the formal limit of inviscid flow for which exact analytical and asymptotic solutions are derived. Due to its practical importance in application to the atomic force microscope and nanoelectromechanical systems, we conduct a detailed assessment of the dependence of this load on the cylinder thickness-to-width ratio. We also assess the validity and accuracy of the widely used infinitely-thin blade approximation. For thin rectangular cylinders of finite thickness, this approximation is found to be excellent for out-of-plane motion, whereas for in-plane oscillations it can exhibit significant error. A database of accurate numerical results for the hydrodynamic load as a function of the thickness-to-width ratio and normalized frequency is also presented, which is expected to be of value in practical application and numerical benchmarking.},

abstract = {Theories of convection from maintained and instantaneous sources of buoyancy are developed, using methods which are applicable to stratified body fluids with any variation of density with height; detailed solutions have been presented for the case of a stably stratified fluid with a linear density gradient. The three main assumptions involved are (i) that the profiles of vertical velocity and buoyancy are similar at all heights, (ii) that the rate of entrainment of fluid at any height is proportional to a characteristic velocity at that height, and (iii) that the fluids are incompressible and do not change volume on mixing, and that local variations in density throughout the motion are small compared to some reference density. The governing equations are derived in non-dimensional form from the conditions of conservation of volume, momentum and buoyancy, and a numerical solution is obtained for the case of the maintained source. This leads to a prediction of the final height to which a plume of light fluid will rise in a stably stratified fluid. Estimates of the constant governing the rate of entrainment are made by comparing the theory with some previous results in uniform fluids, and with the results of new experiments carried out in a stratified salt solution. For the case of an instantaneous source of buoyancy there is an exact solution; the entrainment constant is again estimated from laboratory results for a stratified fluid. Finally, the analysis is applied to the (compressible) atmosphere, by making the customary substitution of potential temperature for temperature. Predictions are made of the height to which smoke plumes from typical sources of heat should rise in a still, stably stratified atmosphere under various conditions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT In this paper a theoretical model of the motion of isolated$\backslash$nbuoyant elements in turbulent surroundings is introduced, which takes$\backslash$ninto account both the growth due to turbulent entrainment and a loss$\backslash$nof buoyant fluid to the environment. On dimensional grounds the outflow$\backslash$nvelocity is taken to be constant and proportional to some characteristic$\backslash$nturbulent velocity in the environment, while the entrainment velocity$\backslash$nis proportional to the upward velocity of the element. Numerical$\backslash$nsolutions of the resulting non-dimensional equations of motion are$\backslash$npresented, corresponding to a wide range of stabilities. Typically,$\backslash$nan element in stable, neutral or moderately unstable surroundings$\backslash$nat first grows and then is eroded away, but at a certain value of$\backslash$na stability parameter {\&}gamma; elements become absolutely unstable$\backslash$nand continue to grow and rise indefinitely. The value of {\&}gamma;$\backslash$nis extremely sensitive to the level of turbulence in the environment,$\backslash$nwhich could therefore exert a controlling influence on the growth$\backslash$nof buoyant elements in unstable conditions; large elements are more$\backslash$nlikely to grow when the level of turbulence is low.Laboratory experiments$\backslash$nhave been carried out in order to test one of the predictions of$\backslash$nthis theory, the form of the dependence of the height attained on$\backslash$ntotal buoyancy and level of turbulence in uniform surroundings.

abstract = {The mechanisms that govern the response of shallow cumulus, such as found in the trade-wind regions, to a warming of the atmosphere in which large-scale atmospheric processes act to keep relative humidity constant are explored. Two robust effects are identified. First, and as is well known, the liquid-water lapse-rate increases with temperature and tends to increase the amount of water in clouds, making clouds more reflective of solar radiation. Second, and less well appreciated, the surface fluxes increase with the saturation specific humidity which itself is a strong function of temperature. Using large-eddy simulations we show that the liquid-water lapse-rate acts as a negative feedback: a positive temperature increase driven by radiative forcing is reduced by the increase in cloud water and hence cloud albedo. However, this effect is more than compensated by a reduction of cloudiness associated with the deepening and relative drying of the boundary layer, driven by larger surface moisture flux...},

Since both clear-sky and cloud albedo are increasing functions of the solar zenith angle, one can choose an absorption-weighted zenith angle that reproduces the spatial- or time-mean absorbed solar radiation. Calculations are performed for a pure scattering atmosphere and with a more detailed radiative transfer model and show that the absorption-weighted zenith angle is usually between the daytime-weighted and insolation-weighted zenith angles but much closer to the insolation-weighted zenith angle in most cases, especially if clouds are responsible for much of the shortwave reflection. Use of daytime-average zenith angle may lead to a high bias in planetary albedo of approximately 3{\%}, equivalent to a deficit in shortwave absorption of approximately 10 W m−2 in the global energy budget (compara...},

Progressive-wave solutions are sought for this problem, without tangent plane simplifications. A linearized theory is derived for small amplitude perturbations about a base westerly flow field, allowing calculation of the linearized progressive wavespeed. This result is then extended to the numerical solution of the full model, to obtain highly non-linear large-amplitude progressive-wave solutions in the form of Fourier series. A detailed picture is developed of how the progressive wavespeed depends on wave amplitude. This approach reveals the presence of non-linear resonance behaviour, with different disjointed solution branches existing at different values of the amplitude. Additionally, we show that the formation of localized low pressure systems cut off from the main flow field is an inherent feature of the non-linear dynamics, once the amplitude forcing reaches a certain critical level. ?? 2006 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {CGILS—the CFMIP-GASS Intercomparison of Large Eddy Models (LESs) and single column models (SCMs)—investigates the mechanisms of cloud feedback in SCMs and LESs under idealized climate change perturbation. This paper describes the CGILS results from 15 SCMs and 8 LES models. Three cloud regimes over the subtropical oceans are studied: shallow cumulus, cumulus under stratocumulus, and well-mixed coastal stratus/stratocumulus. In the stratocumulus and coastal stratus regimes, SCMs without activated shallow convection generally simulated negative cloud feedbacks, while models with active shallow convection generally simulated positive cloud feedbacks. In the shallow cumulus alone regime, this relationship is less clear, likely due to the changes in cloud depth, lateral mixing, and precipitation or a combination of them. The majority of LES models simulated negative cloud feedback in the well-mixed coastal stratus/stratocumulus regime, and positive feedback in the shallow cumulus and stratocumulus regime. A general framework is provided to interpret SCM results: in a warmer climate, the moistening rate of the cloudy layer associated with the surface-based turbulence parameterization is enhanced; together with weaker large-scale subsidence, it causes negative cloud feedback. In contrast, in the warmer climate, the drying rate associated with the shallow convection scheme is enhanced. This causes positive cloud feedback. These mechanisms are summarized as the “NESTS” negative cloud feedback and the “SCOPE” positive cloud feedback (Negative feedback from Surface Turbulence under weaker Subsidence—Shallow Convection PositivE feedback) with the net cloud feedback depending on how the two opposing effects counteract each other. The LES results are consistent with these interpretations.},

abstract = {Today large model discrepancies exist in estimated cloud radiative effects (CREs) and irradiances across 1D radiative transfer schemes aimed for climate models. The primary purpose of this study is to understand physical causes of such model discrepancies, especially in CREs under partly cloudy sky. To achieve this goal, the unique Cloud-Aerosol-Radiation Ensemble Modeling System (CAR) was employed, offline driven by the ERA-Interim global data for July 2004 with no feedback considered. For evaluating each individual contribution from the existing scheme diversity of cloud horizontal inhomogeneity, cloud optical properties, cloud vertical overlap and gas absorptions, several sets of numerical experiments were conducted. It is the first time to explicitly demonstrate that, after removing the most disagreement in cloud fields, model spreads of CREs among the CAR's seven major radiation schemes, as well as those of radiative fluxes, dramatically diminish. Taking global mean CREs for example, their current model ranges can decrease to {\textless}4 Wm-2 from about 10Wm-2 for shortwave, and also to {\textless}4 Wm-2 from 5-8Wm-2 for longwave. Dominant roles of subgrid-scale cloud structures (including vertical overlap and horizontal variability) were proven in general, explaining about 40-75{\%} of the total model spreads. We've also found that model spreads of CREs are very sensitive to cloud cover fractions. Such nonlinear sensitivity can be largely reduced after removing the model difference in the treatments of cloud vertical overlap.},

abstract = {Using five climate model simulations of the response to an abrupt quadrupling of CO2, the authors perform the first simultaneous model intercomparison of cloud feedbacks and rapid radiative adjustments with cloud masking effects removed, partitioned among changes in cloud types and gross cloud properties. Upon CO2 quadrupling, clouds exhibit a rapid reduction in fractional coverage, cloud-top pressure, and optical depth,with each contributing equally to a 1.1 W m22 net cloud radiative adjustment, primarily fromshortwave radiation. Rapid reductions in midlevel clouds and optically thick clouds are important in reducing planetary albedo in every model. As the planet warms, clouds become fewer, higher, and thicker, and global mean net cloud feedback is positive in all but onemodel and results primarily fromincreased trapping of longwave radiation.As was true for earliermodels, high cloud changes are the largest contributor to intermodel spread in longwave and shortwave cloud feedbacks, but low cloud changes are the largest contributor to the mean and spread in net cloud feedback. The importance of the negative optical depth feedback relative to the amount feedback at high latitudes is even more marked than in earlier models. The authors show that the negative longwave cloud adjustment inferred in previous studies is primarily caused by a 1.3 W m22 cloud masking of CO2 forcing. Properly accounting for cloudmasking increases net cloud feedback by 0.3 W m22 K21,whereas accounting for rapid adjustments reduces by 0.14 W m22 K21 the ensemblemean net cloud feedback through a combination of smaller positive cloud amount and altitude feedbacks and larger negative optical depth feedbacks.},

abstract = {We diagnose climate feedback parameters and CO2 forcing including rapid adjustment in twelve atmosphere/mixed-layer-ocean (“slab”) climate models from the CMIP3/CFMIP-1 project (the AR4 ensemble) and fifteen parameter-perturbed versions of the HadSM3 slab model (the PPE). In both ensembles, differences in climate feedbacks can account for approximately twice as much of the range in climate sensitivity as differences in CO2 forcing. In the AR4 ensemble, cloud effects can explain the full range of climate sensitivities, and cloud feedback components contribute four times as much as cloud components of CO2 forcing to the range. Non-cloud feedbacks are required to fully account for the high sensitivities of some models however. The largest contribution to the high sensitivity of HadGEM1 is from a high latitude clear-sky shortwave feedback, and clear-sky longwave feedbacks contribute substantially to the highest sensitivity members of the PPE. Differences in low latitude ocean regions (30°N/S) contribute more to the range than those in mid-latitude oceans (30–55°N/S), low/mid latitude land (55°N/S) or high latitude ocean/land (55–90°N/S), but contributions from these other regions are required to account fully for the higher model sensitivities, for example from land areas in IPSL CM4. Net cloud feedback components over the low latitude oceans sorted into percentile ranges of lower tropospheric stability (LTS) show largest differences among models in stable regions, mainly due to their shortwave components, most of which are positive in spite of increasing LTS. Differences in the mid-stability range are smaller, but cover a larger area, contributing a comparable amount to the range in climate sensitivity. These are strongly anti-correlated with changes in subsidence. Cloud components of CO2 forcing also show the largest differences in stable regions, and are strongly anticorrelated with changes in estimated inversion strength (EIS). This is qualitatively consistent with what would be expected from observed relationships between EIS and low-level cloud fraction. We identify a number of cases where individual models show unusually strong forcings and feedbacks compared to other members of the ensemble. We encourage modelling groups to investigate unusual model behaviours further with sensitivity experiments. Most of the models fail to correctly reproduce the observed relationships between stability and cloud radiative effect in the subtropics, indicating that there remains considerable room for model improvements in the future.},

abstract = {Global climate models used in the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) are examined for the top-of-atmosphere radiation changes as carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases build up from 1950 to 2100. There is an increase in net radiation absorbed, but not in ways commonly assumed. While there is a large increase in the greenhouse effect from increasing greenhouse gases and water vapor (as a feedback), this is offset to a large degree by a decreasing greenhouse effect from reducing cloud cover and increasing radiative emissions from higher temperatures. Instead the main warming from an energy budget standpoint comes from increases in absorbed solar radiation that stem directly from the decreasing cloud amounts. These findings underscore the need to ascertain the credibility of the model changes, especially insofar as changes in clouds are concerned. Citation: Trenberth, K. E., and J. T.

abstract = {The occurrence statistics of hydrometeor layers covering the Earth's surface is described using the first year of millimeter radar data collected by Cloudsat merged with lidar data collected by CALIPSO (July 2006 to June 2007). These satellites are flown in a tight orbital configuration so that they probe nearly the same volumes of the atmosphere within 10–15 s of each other. This configuration combined with the capacity for millimeter radar to penetrate optically thick hydrometeor layers and the ability of the lidar to detect optically thin clouds has allowed us to characterize the vertical and horizontal structure of hydrometeor layers with unprecedented precision. We find that the global hydrometeor coverage averages 76{\%} and demonstrates a fairly smooth annual cycle with a range of 3{\%} peaking in October 2006 and reaching a minimum in March 2007. The geographic distribution of hydrometeor layers defined in terms of layer base, layer top, and layer thickness is described. The predominance of geometrically thin boundary layer clouds is illustrated as is the spatial distribution of upper tropospheric ice clouds in the tropics. The cooccurrence of multiple layers is shown to be a strong function of latitude and geography with cooccurring middle‐level (3 km {\textless} layer base {\textless} 6 km) and high‐level (base {\textgreater} 6 km) layers being predominant over the continents. Cloud layer overlap is also examined, and a bias due to an assumption of maximum fractional overlap in coarse resolution models is quantified and shown to be on the order of −5 to −7{\%} globally maximizing over the high‐latitude continents of the Northern Hemisphere.},

abstract = {Clouds are a key component of the climate system affecting radiative balances and the hydrological cycle. Previous studies from the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) showed quite large biases in the simulated cloud climatology affecting all GCMs as well as a remarkable degree of variation among the models that represented the state of the art circa 2005. Here the progress that has been made in recent years is measured by comparing mean cloud properties, interannual variability, and the climatological seasonal cycle from the CMIP5 models with satellite observations and with results from comparable CMIP3 experiments. The focus is on three climate-relevant cloud parameters: cloud amount, liquid water path, and cloud radiative forcing. The comparison shows that intermodel differences are still large in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 5 (CMIP5) simulations, and reveals some small improvements of particular cloud properties in some regions in the CMIP5 ensemble over CMIP3. In CMIP5 there is an improved agreement of the modeled interannual variability of liquid water path and of the modeled longwave cloud forcing over mid- and high-latitude oceans with observations. However, the differences in the simulated cloud climatology from CMIP3 and CMIP5 are generally small, and there is very little to no improvement apparent in the tropical and subtropical regions in CMIP5. Comparisons of the results from the coupled CMIP5 models with their atmosphere-only versions run with observed SSTs show remarkably similar biases in the simulated cloud climatologies. This suggests the treatments of subgrid-scale cloud and boundary layer processes are directly implicated in the poor perfor- mance of current GCMs in simulating realistic cloud fields.},

Atmospheric gases in semigray atmospheres make use of constant absorption coefficients in finite-width spectral bands. Here, such a semigray absorption is introduced in a one-dimensional (1D) radiative–convective model with a stratosphere in radiative equilibrium and a troposphere fully saturated with water vapor, which is the semigray gas. A single atmospheric window in the infrared spectrum has been assumed. In contrast to the single absolute limit of OLR found in gray atmospheres, semigray ones may also show a relative limit. This means that both finite and infinite runaway effects may arise in some semigray cases. Of particular importance is the finding of an entirely new branch of stable steady states that does not appear in gray atmospheres. This new multiple equilibrium is a consequence of the nongray absorption only. It is suspected that this new set of stable solutions has not been previously revealed in analyses of radiative–convective models since it does not appear for an atmosphere with nongray parameters similar to those for the earth's current state.},

The response is characterized by an initial fast exponential decay with an e-folding time smaller than 5 yr, leaving behind a remnant that evolves more slowly. The slow component is estimated to be small at present, as measured by the global mean near-surface air temperature, and, in the model examined, grows to 0.4C by 2100 in the A1B scenario from the Special Report on Emissions Scenarios (SRES), and then to 1.4C by 2300 if one holds radiative forcing fixed after 2100. The dominance of the fast component at present is supported by examining the response to an instantaneous doubling of CO2 and by the excellent fit to the models ensemble mean twentieth-century evolution with a simple one-box model with no long times scales.},

The logarithmic relationship holds for monochromatic radiance requires an explanation beyond the conventional ideas based on the spectroscopic features of the gas absorption lines.

abstract = {Climate change sensitivities of subtropical cloud-topped marine boundary layers are analyzed using large-eddy simulation (LES) of three CGILS cases of well-mixed stratocumulus, cumulus under stratocumulus, and shallow cumulus cloud regimes, respectively. For each case, a steadily forced control simulation on a small horizontally doubly-periodic domain is run 10-20 days into quasi-steady state. The LES is rerun to steady-state with forcings perturbed by changes in temperature, free-tropospheric relative humidity, CO2 concentration, subsidence, inversion stability, and wind speed; cloud responses to combined forcings superpose approximately linearly. For all three cloud regimes and 2×CO2 forcing perturbations estimated from the CMIP3 multimodel mean, the LES predicts positive shortwave cloud feedback, like most CMIP3 global climate models. At both stratocumulus locations, the cloud remains overcast but thins in the warmer, moister, CO2-enhanced climate, due to the combined effects of an increased lower-tropospheric vertical humidity gradient and an enhanced free tropospheric greenhouse effect that reduces the radiative driving of turbulence. Reduced subsidence due to weakening of tropical overturning circulations partly counteracts these two factors by raising the inversion and allowing the cloud layer to deepen. These compensating mechanisms may explain the large scatter in low cloud feedbacks predicted by climate models. CMIP3-predicted changes in wind speed, inversion stability, and free-tropospheric relative humidity have lesser impacts on the cloud thickness. In the shallow cumulus regime, precipitation regulates the simulated boundary layer depth and vertical structure. Cloud droplet (aerosol) concentration limits the boundary layer depth and affects the simulated cloud feedbacks.},

During the last decade, MPDATA has evolved from a simple advection scheme to a general approach for integrating the conservation laws of geophysical fluids on micro-to-planetary scales. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the basic concepts leading to a family of MPDATA schemes, to review existing MPDATA options, and to demonstrate the use of MPDATA to effectively construct two distinct types of models (elastic and anelastic) for complex geophysical flows.},

abstract = {A new dynamical framework for the Cooperative Institute for Mesoscale Meteorological Studies large eddy simulation model (CIMMS LES) with an explicit microphysics scheme is developed. It is shown that simulation results are very sensitive to the drop spectrum remapping technique used in condensation calculations; however, the results are almost insensitive to doubling of the spectrum resolution used in the CIMMS LES model. It is also shown that the drop coagulation procedure conserves the liquid water content as long as the predominant radius of the drop size spectrum, defined as the cube root of the ratio of the drop radar reflectivity to the liquid water content, is below a threshold value of 250 mu m Finally, it is demonstrated that for typical maritime conditions this threshold radius is exceeded only in 0.1{\%} of all cloudy points. Realism of the model is evaluated by a direct comparison of its predictions with the aircraft observations of a stratocumulus-topped boundary layer. The first simulation is based on the U.K. Meteorological Research Flight flight 526 measurements collected over the North Sea on 22 July 1982; the second simulation corresponds to the Atlantic Stratocumulus Transition Experiment flight A209 on 12-13 June 1992. The model is able to reproduce reasonably well most of the observed boundary layer parameters, including turbulent fluxes and variances of various fields, the intensity and vertical distribution of the turbulent kinetic energy, the upward and downward radiative fluxes, and the cloud drop spectra. It is speculated that the most noticeable discrepancy, which is an underestimation of the concentration of drops smaller than 6 mu m near the cloud top, may be an indicator of the need to refine theoretical formulation of small-scale turbulent mixing.},

For the high-resolution approach, droplet nucleation is calculated from Kohler theory applied to a distribution of aerosol that activates at a given supersaturation.

Modern day model budgets are validated against the European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts Interim Reanalysis. In the winter half year transient eddies converge moisture across the continent while the mean flow wets the west from central California northward and dries the southwest. In the summer half year there is widespread mean flow moisture divergence across the west and convergence over the Great Plains that is offset by transient eddy divergence. In the winter half year the models project drying for the southwest and wetting to the north. Changes in the mean flow moisture convergence are largely responsible across the west but intensified transient eddy moisture convergence wets the northeast. In the summer half year widespread declines in P − E are supported by mean flow moisture divergence across the west and transient eddy divergence in the Plains. The changes in mean flow convergence are related to increases in specific humidity but also depend on changes in the mean flow including increased low level divergence in the southwest and a zonally varying wave that wets the west and east coasts in winter and dries the southwest. Increased transient eddy fluxes occur even as low level eddy activity weakens and arise from strengthened humidity gradients. Full explanation of North American hydroclimate changes will require explanation of mean and transient circulation changes and the coupling between the moisture and circulation fields.},

abstract = {Using high-resolution cloud-resolving simulations with different CO2 concentrations, local precipitation fluxes are found to obey Clausius–Clapeyron (CC) scaling. Previous studies of the effect of CO2 concentration on precipitation extremes have used general circulation models, which are poor platforms for studying tropical convection because convection is parameterized. In idealized cloud-resolving simulations, it is possible to identify not only the changes in local precipitation fluxes, but also the factors responsible for those changes. There are many properties of convection that can change as the atmosphere warms, each of which could produce deviations from CC scaling. These properties include the effective water-vapor gradient, cloud pressure depth, and cloud velocity. A simple theory is developed that predicts the changes in these properties consistent with CC scaling. Convection in the cloud-resolving simulations is found to change as predicted by this theory, leading to an ∼20{\%} increase in local precipitation fluxes when the CO2 concentration is doubled. Overall, an increase in CO2 leads to more vigorous convection, composed of clouds that are wider, taller, and faster.},

The mass flux scheme is coupled to a 1.5-order turbulence closure model with an entrainment closure for convective boundary layers. Model performance is verified using single-column-model simulations at relatively high vertical resolution of pure trade-cumulus convection and a cumulus to stratocumulus transition. Mixing rates, cloud cover, and vertical flux profiles, as deduced from previously published large-eddy simulation studies, are well reproduced by the parameterization. The model is used to demonstrate that height variations of lateral mixing rates can be suc- cessfully captured by a simple implementation of a buoyancy-sorting mechanism in the updraft cloud model.

abstract = {The increase in solar luminosity over geological timescales should warm the Earth's climate, increasing water evaporation, which will in turn enhance the atmospheric greenhouse effect. Above a certain critical insolation, this destabilizing greenhouse feedback can 'run away' until the oceans have completely evaporated. Through increases in stratospheric humidity, warming may also cause evaporative loss of the oceans to space before the runaway greenhouse state occurs. The critical insolation thresholds for these processes, however, remain uncertain because they have so far been evaluated using one-dimensional models that cannot account for the dynamical and cloud feedback effects that are key stabilizing features of the Earth's climate. Here we use a three-dimensional global climate model to show that the insolation threshold for the runaway greenhouse state to occur is about 375 W m(-2), which is significantly higher than previously thought. Our model is specifically developed to quantify the climate response of Earth-like planets to increased insolation in hot and extremely moist atmospheres. In contrast with previous studies, we find that clouds have a destabilizing feedback effect on the long-term warming. However, subsident, unsaturated regions created by the Hadley circulation have a stabilizing effect that is strong enough to shift the runaway greenhouse limit to higher values of insolation than are inferred from one-dimensional models. Furthermore, because of wavelength-dependent radiative effects, the stratosphere remains sufficiently cold and dry to hamper the escape of atmospheric water, even at large fluxes. This has strong implications for the possibility of liquid water existing on Venus early in its history, and extends the size of the habitable zone around other stars.},

abstract = {The response of convection to changing sea surface temperature (SST) in the absence of large-scale Bow is examined, using a three-dimensional cloud resolving model. The model includes a five-category bulk microphysical scheme representing snow, ice, graupel, rain, and cloud amounts in addition to an interactive radiation scheme for the shortwave and infrared. Long integrations are made to achieve a radiative-convective equilibrium state for SSTs of 298, 300, and 302 K, for which cloud and convection statistics are analyzed.The main conclusion of the paper is that, despite significant temperature sensitivities in many of the conversion terms between bulk water categories, convection is very insensitive to changing SST in the absence of large-scale how. This is a result of the moist adiabatic temperature profile that the tropical atmosphere is constrained to take. A parcel of air rising through a deep convective cloud experiences approximately the same range of temperatures but at higher altitudes as SST increases. Thus the vertical profiles of cloud fraction and other cloud-related statistics are simply shifted in height, but not changed in overall magnitude.The small changes in cloud properties that do occur lead to a small reduction in cloud fraction as SST increases. This appears to be due to an increase in graupel amounts with respect to snow, giving smaller cloud fractions since graupel has a higher fall velocity. The radiative effects of the changes in atmospheric properties are examined and it is found that the model atmosphere exhibits no supergreenhouse effect since atmospheric relative humidity is not altered significantly by the SST changes. The water vapor feedback effect is largely canceled by the change in temperature. Clouds have a negligibly small, but highly nonlinear, feedback in the model climate, in the absence of large-scale flow.},

This radiative–convective framework is proposed as a useful tool for studying some of the interactions between convection and larger-scale dynamics and the effects of differing modeling assumptions on convective organization and cloud feedbacks. For the column physics utilized here, from the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) AM2 model, many of the properties of the homogeneous, nonrotating model are closely tied to the fraction of precipitation that is large-scale, rather than convective. Significant large-scale precipitation appears above a critical temperature and then increases with further increases in temperature. The amount of large-scale precipitation is a function of horizontal resolution and can also be controlled by modifying the convection scheme, as is illustrated here by modifying assumptions concerning entrainment into convective plumes.

abstract = {Within MAP, one of the scientific projects was devoted to ‘Boundary Layers in Complex Terrain'. In a number of subprojects, boundary-layer issues were addressed and detailed high-resolution multi-sensor observations were combined with simulation by models allowing for adequate parametrization of turbulence processes. In this contribution, the projects are briefly introduced and an attempt is made to summarize their key findings and to put them into a joint perspective. Spatial variability is found to be large but strictly related to topography and therefore allowing for possible parametrization. Traditional boundary-layer scaling approaches cannot simply be applied over highly complex topography, but some of the MAP findings suggest the potential for suitable extensions of those scaling relations to cover various cases of complex terrain. The mean boundary-layer structure and thermally driven flows in narrow valleys are found not to be generally in line with previous results from larger valleys elsewhere. Furthermore, local circulations are reported to contribute considerably to exchange between valley and free troposphere. In particular, the range of their effects on the lower atmosphere seems to be larger than just turbulent transport within the planetary boundary layer would suggest. Thus in larger-scale numerical models where the topography is not resolved, possible sub-grid parametrizations for local exchange seem to be in order.},

abstract = {This study explores connections between process-level modeling of convection and global climate model (GCM) simulated clouds and cloud feedback to global warming through a set of perturbed-physics and perturbed sea surface temperature experiments. A bulk diagnostic approach is constructed, and a set of variables is derived and demonstrated to be useful in understanding the simulated relationship. In particular, a novel bulk quantity, the convective precipitation efficiency or equivalently the convective detrainment efficiency, is proposed as a simple measure of the aggregated properties of parameterized convection im- portant to the GCM simulated clouds. As the convective precipitation efficiency increases in the perturbed- physics experiments, both liquid and ice water path decrease, with low and middle cloud fractions diminishing at a faster rate than high cloud fractions. This asymmetry results in a large sensitivity of top-of-atmosphere net cloud radiative forcing to changes in convective precipitation efficiency in this limited set of models. For global warming experiments, intermodel variations in the response of cloud condensate, low cloud fraction, and total cloud radiative forcing are well explained by model variations in response to total pre- cipitation (or detrainment) efficiency. Despite significant variability, all of the perturbed-physics models produce a sizable increase in precipitation efficiency to warming.Asubstantial fraction of the increase is due to its convective component, which depends on the parameterization of cumulus mixing and convective microphysical processes. The increase in convective precipitation efficiency and associated change in con- vective cloud height distribution owing to warming explains the increased cloud feedback and climate sen- sitivity in recently developed Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory GCMs. The results imply that a cumulus scheme using fractional removal of condensate for precipitation and inverse calculation of the en- trainment rate tends to produce a lower climate sensitivity than a scheme using threshold removal for pre- cipitation and the entrainment rate formulated inversely dependent on convective depth.},

The large-scale relative humidity and cumulus mass flux are also used in the parameterization as secondary predictors. The cloud amount is assumed to vary exponentially with the large-scale average condensate mixing ratio.

abstract = {The effects of the nongray absorption (i.e., atmospheric opacity varying with wavelength) on the possible upper bound of the outgoing longwave radiation (OLR) emitted by a planetary atmosphere have been examined. This analysis is based on the semigray approach, which appears to be a reasonable compromise between the complexity of nongray models and the simplicity of the gray assumption (i.e., atmospheric absorption independent of wavelength). Atmospheric gases in semigray atmospheres make use of constant absorption coefficients in finite-width spectral bands. Here, such a semigray absorption is introduced in a one-dimensional (1D) radiative–convective model with a stratosphere in radiative equilibrium and a troposphere fully saturated with water vapor, which is the semigray gas. A single atmospheric window in the infrared spectrum has been assumed. In contrast to the single absolute limit of OLR found in gray atmospheres, semigray ones may also show a relative limit. This means that both finite and infinite runaway effects may arise in some semigray cases. Of particular importance is the finding of an entirely new branch of stable steady states that does not appear in gray atmospheres. This new multiple equilibrium is a consequence of the nongray absorption only. It is suspected that this new set of stable solutions has not been previously revealed in analyses of radiative–convective models since it does not appear for an atmosphere with nongray parameters similar to those for the earth's current state.},

In principle, the low- and high-order moments share the same probability density function (PDF). One closure assumption, then, is the shape of this family of PDFs. When the higher-order moments involve both velocity and thermodynamic scalars, often the PDF shape has been assumed to be a double or triple delta function. This is equivalent to assuming a mass-flux model with no subplume variability. However, PDF families other than delta functions can be assumed. This is because the assumed PDF methodology is fairly general. This paper proposes closures for several third- and fourth-order moments. To derive the closures, the moments are assumed to be consistent with a particular PDF family, namely, a mixture of two trivariate Gaussians.

Discussion is focused on density stratified flow due to temperature. However, other dependent variables—such as water vapor and droplet density—can be treated in analogous fashion. It is, in fact, the anticipation of additional physical complexity in modeling turbulent flow fields that partially motivates the interest in an organized process of analytical simplification.

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

The results enable us to compare, for the first time from observations, the geographical distributions of responses to individual influences consistent with their global impacts. We find a response to solar forcing quite different from that reported in several papers published recently in this journal, and zonally averaged responses to both natural and anthropogenic forcings that differ distinctly from those indicated by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, whose conclusions depended on model simulations. Anthropogenic warming estimated directly from the historical observations is more pronounced between 45°S and 50°N than at higher latitudes whereas the model-simulated trends have minimum values in the tropics and increase steadily from 30 to 70°N.},

@article{Parmentier2014,
abstract = {Context. Semi-grey atmospheric models (with one opacity for the visible and one opacity for the infrared) are useful for understanding the global structure of irradiated atmospheres, their dynamics, and the interior structure and evolution of planets, brown dwarfs, and stars. When compared to direct numerical radiative transfer calculations for irradiated exoplanets, however, these models systematically overestimate the temperatures at low optical depths, independently of the opacity parameters. Aims: We investigate why semi-grey models fail at low optical depths and provide a more accurate approximation to the atmospheric structure by accounting for the variable opacity in the infrared. Methods: Using the Eddington approximation, we derive an analytical model to account for lines and/or bands in the infrared. Four parameters (instead of two for the semi-grey models) are used: a visible opacity ($\kappa$v), two infrared opacities, ($\kappa$1 and $\kappa$2), and $\beta$ (the fraction of the energy in the beam with opacities $\kappa$1). We consider that the atmosphere receives an incident irradiation in the visible with an effective temperature Tirr and at an angle $\mu$∗, and that it is heated from below with an effective temperature Tint. Results: Our non-grey, irradiated line model is found to provide a range of temperatures that is consistent with that obtained by numerical calculations. We find that if the stellar flux is absorbed at optical depth larger than $\tau$lim = ($\kappa$R/$\kappa$1$\kappa$2)($\kappa$R$\kappa$P/3)1/2, it is mainly transported by the channel of lowest opacity whereas if it is absorbed at $\tau$ ≳ $\tau$lim it is mainly transported by the channel of highest opacity, independently of the spectral width of those channels. For low values of $\beta$ (expected when lines are dominant), we find that the non-grey effects significantly cool the upper atmosphere. However, for $\beta$ ≳ 1/2 (appropriate in the presence of bands with a wavelength-dependence smaller than or comparable to the width of the Planck function), we find that the temperature structure is affected down to infrared optical depths unity and deeper as a result of the so-called blanketing effect. Conclusions: The expressions that we derive can be used to provide a proper functional form for algorithms that invert the atmospheric properties from spectral information. Because a full atmospheric structure can be calculated directly, these expressions should be useful for simulations of the dynamics of these atmospheres and of the thermal evolution of the planets. Finally, they should be used to test full radiative transfer models and to improve their convergence.

abstract = {Radiative-convective equilibrium models of planetary atmospheres are discussed for the case when the infrared opacity is due to a vapor in equilibrium with its liquid or solid phase. For a grey gas, or for a gas which absorbs at all infrared wavelengths, equilibrium is impossible when the solar constant exceeds a critical value. Equilibrium therefore requires that the condensed phase evaporates into the atmosphere. Moist adiabatic and pseudoadiabatic atmospheres in which the condensing vapor is a major atmospheric constituent are considered. This situation would apply if the solar constant were supercritical with respect to an abundant substance such as water. It is shown that the condensing gas would be a major constituent at all levels in such an atmosphere. Photodissociation of water in the primordial Venus atmosphere is discussed in this context.},

@article{jeevanjee2015,
abstract = {AbstractThe Davies-Jones formulation of effective buoyancy is used to define inertial and buoyant components of vertical force and to develop an intuition for these components by considering simple cases. This decomposition is applied to the triggering of new boundary layer mass flux by cold pools in a cloud-resolving simulation of radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE). The triggering is found to be dominated by inertial forces, and this is explained by estimating the ratio of the inertial forcing to the buoyancy forcing, which scales as H/h, where H is the characteristic height of the initial downdraft and h is the characteristic height of the mature cold pool's gust front. In a simulation of the transition from shallow to deep convection, the buoyancy forcing plays a dominant role in triggering mass flux in the shallow regime, but the force balance tips in favor of inertial forcing just as precipitation sets in, consistent with the RCE results.},

@article{goldblatt2013,
abstract = {The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are expected to be in long-term radiation balance: an increase in the absorption of solar radiation warms the surface and troposphere, which leads to a matching increase in the emission of thermal radiation. Warming a wet planet such as Earth would make the atmosphere moist and optically thick such that only thermal radiation emitted from the upper troposphere can escape to space. Hence, for a hot moist atmosphere, there is an upper limit on the thermal emission that is unrelated to surface temperature. If the solar radiation absorbed exceeds this limit, the planet will heat uncontrollably and the entire ocean will evaporate—the so-called runaway greenhouse. Here we model the solar and thermal radiative transfer in incipient and complete runaway greenhouse atmospheres at line-by-line spectral resolution using amodern spectral database.We find a thermal radiation limit of 282Wm−2 (lower than previously reported) and that 294Wm−2 of solar radiation is absorbed (higher than previously reported).Therefore, a steamatmosphere induced by such a runaway greenhouse may be a stable state for a planet receiving a similar amount of solar radiation as Earth today. Avoiding a runaway greenhouse on Earth requires that the atmosphere is subsaturated withwater, and that the albedo effect of clouds exceeds their greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing, but anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient.},

Eventually, perhaps, a great deal: the overall climate response to increasing atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases may prove much simpler and more predictable than the chaos of short-term weather. Quantifying the diversity of possible responses is essential for any objective, probability-based climate forecast, and this task will require a new generation of climate modelling experiments, systematically exploring the range of model behaviour that is consistent with observations. It will be substantially harder to quantify the range of possible changes in the hydrologic cycle than in global-mean temperature, both because the observations are less complete and because the physical constraints are weaker.},

abstract = {Climate models robustly simulate weakened mean circulations of the tropical atmosphere in direct response to increased carbon dioxide (CO2). The direct response to CO2, defined by the response to radiative forcing in the absence of changes in sea surface temperature, affects tropical precipitation and tropical cyclone genesis, and these changes have been tied to the weakening of the mean tropical circulation. The mechanism underlying this direct CO2-forced circulation change has not been elucidated. Here, I demonstrate that this circulation weakening results from spatial structure in CO2's radiative forcing. In regions of ascending circulation, such as the intertropical convergence zone, the CO2 radiative forcing is reduced, or ``masked,'' by deep-convective clouds and high humidity; in subsiding regions, such as the subtropics, the CO2 radiative forcing is larger because the atmosphere is drier and deep-convective clouds are infrequent. The spatial structure of the radiative forcing reduces the need for the atmosphere to transport energy. This, in turn, weakens the mass overturning of the tropical circulation. The previously unidentified mechanism is demonstrated in a hierarchy of atmospheric general circulation model simulations with altered radiative transfer to suppress the cloud masking of the radiative forcing. The mechanism depends on the climatological distribution of clouds and humidity, rather than uncertain changes in these quantities. Masked radiative forcing thereby offers an explanation for the robustness of the direct circulation weakening under increased CO2.},

abstract = {Energetic constraints on precipitation are useful for understanding the response of the hydrological cycle to ongoing climate change, its response to possible geoengineering schemes, and the limits on precipitation in very warm climates of the past. Much recent progress has been made in quantifying the different forcings and feedbacks on precipitation and in understanding how the transient responses of precipitation and temperature might differ qualitatively. Here, we introduce the basic ideas and review recent progress. We also examine the extent to which energetic constraints on precipitation may be viewed as radiative constraints and the extent to which they are confirmed by available observations. Challenges remain, including the need to better demonstrate the link between energetics and precipitation in observations and to better understand energetic constraints on precipitation at sub-global length scales.},

abstract = {A minimum atmospheric temperature, or tropopause, occurs at a pressure of around 0.1 bar in the atmospheres of Earth1, Titan2, Jupiter3, Saturn4, Uranus and Neptune4, despite great differences in atmospheric composition, gravity, internal heat and sunlight. In all of these bodies, the tropopause separates a stratosphere with a temperature profile that is controlled by the absorption of short-wave solar radiation, from a region below characterized by convection, weather and clouds5,6. However, it is not obvious why the tropopause occurs at the specific pressure near 0.1 bar. Here we use a simple, physically based model7 to demonstrate that, at atmospheric pressures lower than 0.1 bar, transparency to thermal radiation allows short-wave heating to dominate, creating a stratosphere. At higher pressures, atmospheres become opaque to thermal radiation, causing temperatures to increase with depth and convection to ensue. A common dependence of infrared opacity on pressure, arising from the shared physics of molecular absorption, sets the 0.1 bar tropopause.We reason that a tropopause at a pressure of approximately 0.1 bar is characteristic ofmany thick atmospheres, including exoplanets and exomoons in our galaxy and beyond. Judicious use of this rule could help constrain the atmospheric structure, and thus the surface environments and habitability, of exoplanets. ‘Atmospheric},

abstract = {In the Southwest and Central Plains of Western North America, climate change is expected to increase drought severity in the coming decades. These regions nevertheless experienced extended Medieval-era droughts that were more persistent than any historical event, providing crucial targets in the paleoclimate record for bench-marking the severity of future drought risks. We use an empirical drought reconstruction and three soil moisture metrics from 17 state-of-the-art general circulation models to show that these models project significantly drier conditions in the later half of the 21st century compared to the 20th century and earlier paleoclimatic intervals. This desiccation is consistent across most of the models and moisture balance variables, indicating a coherent and robust drying response to warming despite the diversity of models and metrics analyzed. Notably, future drought risk will likely exceed even the driest centuries of the Medieval Climate Anomaly (1100–1300 CE) in both moderate (RCP 4.5) and high (RCP 8.5) future emissions scenarios, leading to unprecedented drought conditions during the last millennium.},

abstract = {Due to the intrinsic complexities associated with modeling land-atmosphere inter- actions, global models typically use elaborate land surface and boundary layer physics parameterizations. Unfortunately, it is difficult to use elaborate models, by them- selves, to develop a deeper understanding of how land surface parameters affect the coupled land-atmosphere system. At the same time, it is also increasingly important to gain a deeper understanding of the role of changes in land cover, land use, and ecosys- tem function as forcings and feedbacks in past and future climate change. To improve the foundation of our understanding, we outline a framework for boundary layer cli- mate sensitivity based on surface energy balance; just as global climate sensitivity is based on top-of-atmosphere energy balance. We develop an analytic theory for the boundary layer climate sensitivity of an idealized model of a diurnally averaged well- mixed boundary layer over land. This analytic sensitivity theory identifies changes in the properties of the land surface—including moisture availability, albedo, and aero- dynamic roughness—as forcings, and identifies strong negative feedbacks associated with the surface fluxes of latent and sensible heat. We show that our theory can explain nearly all of the sensitivity of the Betts (2000) full system of equations. Favor- able comparison of the theory and the simulation results from a two-column radiative convective model suggests that the theory may be broadly useful for unifying our understanding of how changes in land use or ecosystem function may affect climate change.

abstract = {Sea surface temperature (SST) in roughly 50{\%} of the tropical Pacific Ocean is warm enough (SST greater than 300 K) to permit deep convection. This paper examines the effects of deep convection on the climatological mean vertical distributions of water vapor and its greenhouse effect over such warm oceans. The study, which uses a combination of satellite radiation budget observations, atmospheric soundings deployed from ships, and radiation model calculations, also examines the link between SST, vertical distribution of water vapor, and its greenhouse effect in the tropical oceans. Since the focus of the study is on the radiative effects of water vapor, the radiation model calculations do not include the effects of clouds. The data are grouped into nonconvective and convective categories using SST as an index for convective activity. On average, convective regions are more humid, trap significantly more longwave radiation, and emit more radiation to the sea surface. The greenhouse effect in regions of convection operates as per classical ideas, that is, as the SST increases, the atmosphere traps the excess longwave energy emitted by the surface and reradiates it locally back to the ocean surface. The important departure from the classical picture is that the net (up minus down) fluxes at the surface and at the top of the atmosphere decrease with an increase in SST; that is, the surface and the surface-troposphere column lose the ability to radiate the excess energy to space. The cause of this super greenhouse effect at the surface is the rapid increase in the lower-troposphere humidity with SST; that of the column is due to a combination of increase in humidity in the entire column and increase in the lapse rate within the lower troposphere. The increase in the vertical distribution of humidity far exceeds that which can be attributed to the temperature dependence of saturation vapor pressure; that is, the tropospheric relative humidity is larger in convective regions. The positive coupling between SST and the radiative warming of the surface by the water vapor greenhouse effect is also shown to exist on interannual time scales.},

abstract = {This paper introduces a simple method for deriving climatological values of the longwave flux emitted from the clear sky atmosphere to the ice-free ocean surface. It is shown using both theory and data from simulations how the ratio of the surface to top-of-atmosphere (TOA) flux is a simple function of water vapor (W) and a validation of the simple relationship is presented based on a limited set of surface flux measurements. The rms difference between the retrieved surface fluxes and the simulated surface fluxes is approximately 6 W/sq m. The clear sky column cooling rate of the atmosphere is derived from the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) values of the clear sky TOA flux and the surface flux retrieved using Special Scanning Microwave Imager (SSM/I) measurements of w together with ERBE clear sky fluxes. The relationship between this column cooling rate, w, and the sea surface temperature (SST) is explored and it is shown how the cooling rate systematically increases as both w and SST increase. The uncertainty implied in these estmates of cooling are approximately +/- 0.2 K/d. The effects of clouds on this longwave cooling are also explored by placing bounds on the possible impact of clouds on the column cooling rate based on certain assumptions about the effect of clouds on the longwave flux to the surface. It is shown how the longwave effects of clouds in a moist atmosphere where the column water vapor exceeds approximately 30 kg/sq m may be estimated from presently available satellite data with an uncertainty estimated to be approximately 0.2 K/d. Based on an approach described in this paper, we show how clouds in these relatively moist regions decrease the column cooling by almost 50{\%} of the clear sky values and the existence of significant longitudinal gradients in column radiative heating across the equatorial and subtropical Pacific Ocean.},

abstract = {A scheme is described for the calculation of the atmospheric infra-red radiative cooling rate which is suitable for use at all levels. It uses the Curtis matrix method together with the Curtis-Godson approximation in a form which includes the influence of temperature on line intensity. Doppler effect is included. Because of its simplicity the Goody random model is used for all the absorption bands considered (H2O rotation and 6.3mu, CO2 15mu, O3 9.6mu); the use of more accurate models as they become available presents no fundamental difficulty and in any case many of the topics investigated are not particularly sensitive to the spectral model used. A method of reducing the number of spectral intervals is described and its accuracy demonstrated. An accurate method of dealing with diffuse radiation is used to test the diffuse approximation, with the result that the constant factor 1.66 originally proposed by Elsasser is found to be quite adequate for most purposes. Cooling rate errors caused by the following factors are estimated: (1) random and systematic errors in the initial temperature and humidity profiles; (2) the size of the vertical step used in computation; (3) neglecting the temperature dependence of the Curtis matrix; (4) non-linear effects in forming climatological means. It is shown that the easily computed lsquocooling to spacersquo is often a good approximation. All the error investigations are based on direct calculations of the cooling profile. Some comparisons with other techniques are presented and a number of examples of meteorological interest are used to illustrate the versatility of the computing scheme.},

By analyzing the energy budget of the troposphere, we find that changes are dominated by processes robustly simulated by GCMs. Importantly, shortwave cloud feedbacks, whose uncertainty is largely responsible for the wide range of GCM temperature climate sensitivities, are shown to have little effect. This is because these mainly arise from the scattering of shortwave radiation that has little impact on the tropospheric heating that controls precipitation. Hence, we expect that the range of simulated precipitation sensitivities to temperature will not change greatly in future GCMs, despite the recent suggestion that satellite observations indicate that GCM precipitation changes are significantly in error.},

abstract = {A cloud-resolving model is used to investigate the effect of warming on high percentiles of precipitation (precipitation extremes) in the idealized setting of radiative-convective equilibrium. While this idealized setting does not allow for several factors that influence precipitation in the tropics, it does allow for an evaluation of the response of precipitation extremes to warming in simulations with resolved rather than parameterized convection. The methodology developed should also be applicable to less idealized simulations. Modeled precipitation extremes are found to increase in magnitude in response to an increase in sea surface temperature. A dry static energy budget is used to relate the changes in precipitation extremes to changes in atmospheric temperature, vertical velocity, and precipitation efficiency. To first order, the changes in precipitation extremes are captured by changes in the mean temperature structure of the atmosphere. Changes in vertical velocities play a secondary role and tend to weaken the strength of precipitation extremes, despite an intensification of updraft velocities in the upper troposphere. The influence of changes in condensate transports on precipitation extremes is quantified in terms of a precipitation efficiency; it does not change greatly with warming. Tropical precipitation extremes have previously been found to increase at a greater fractional rate than the amount of atmospheric water vapor in observations of present-day variability and in some climate model simulations with parameterized convection. But the fractional increases in precipitation extremes in the cloud-resolving simulations are comparable in magnitude to those in surface water vapor concentrations (owing to a partial cancellation between dynamical and thermodynamical changes), and are substantially less than the fractional increases in column water vapor.},

abstract = {A model for the accelerated calculation of clear sky fluxes based on the line-by-line radiance model FASCODE has been developed and applied to the calculation of cooling rates for atmospheric water vapor. The model achieves computational accuracies for the longwave upwelling and downwelling fluxes of the order of 0.2{\%}, an accuracy well within current limitations imposed by uncertainties in the spectral parameters, the line shape, and the associated continua. For the same treatment of line shape, the Voigt profile with a 10 cm−1 cutoff and no continuum, the results from the present model are in acceptable agreement with those from two other line-by-line models reported as part of the intercomparison of radiation codes used in climate models (ICRCCM). For this line profile and the mid-latitude summer atmosphere, the largest difference between the results from our model and the Goddard Laboratory for Atmospheres (GLA) model occurs for the downwelling flux at the surface, with the present model providing a value greater than that from GLA. The differences are generally consistent with greater atmospheric opacity from the present model, attributable to the inclusion of a self-broadening component for the half width for water and to finer spectral sampling in the lower-pressure regime. Utilization of the line shape and associated continuum model included in FASCODE gives results that are significantly different from those provided by the other two models. This radiance model, including contributions from the foreign continuum as well as from a modified self-continuum, has received extensive validation against measured radiance spectra, an example of which is provided. For the mid-latitude summer atmosphere the principal contribution from the foreign continuum occurs in the upper troposphere in the 250–350 cm−1 spectral region, whereas the contribution from the self-continuum, dependent on the square of the water vapor density, is greatest in the lower troposphere. For the mid-latitude summer atmosphere the foreign continuum contributes 0.4 Kd−1 or 20{\%} to the cooling in the upper troposphere and the self-continuum contributes 1.9 K d−1 to the cooling rate at the surface due to water vapor. The latter is 0.17 K d−1 less than the cooling rate from the GLA model which is principally due to a modification of the self-continuum. A significant result that has developed from the present work is the insight into atmospheric radiative processes provided by spectral profiles of the cooling rate. In the spectral domain there exists a mapping between the altitude and the molecular absorption strength as weighted by the Planck function. The extremely high correlation between the outgoing spectral radiance at the top of the atmosphere and the spectral cooling rate profile suggests that measurement of the outgoing spectral radiance can provide important information about atmospheric state that is not available from spectrally integrated quantities. Our results also indicate the critical importance of the spectral region from 100 to 600 cm−1 for the radiative transfer associated with atmospheric water vapor.},

abstract = {Convective self-aggregation refers to a phenomenon in cloud-resolving simulations wherein the atmosphere spontaneously develops a circulation with a convecting moist patch and a nonconvecting dry patch. All previous studies have found a sharp transition to aggregated convection when the domain size exceeds a critical threshold, typically in the range of 200–300 km. Here, we show that cold pools are responsible for this sharp transition. When cold pools are inhibited, self-aggregation occurs at all domain sizes. In this case, the aggregation strength decreases smoothly as the domain size L is decreased below about 200–300 km. A streamfunction analysis reveals two distinct sources for the air subsiding into the dry-patch boundary layer: a moist, shallow circulation and a dry, deep circulation. The deep circulation scales with L, whereas the shallow circulation does not. At small L, the shallow circulation dominates, thereby weakening the aggregation.},

abstract = {Abstract The tropical tropopause layer (TTL), and in particular the cold point tropopause, has been previously suggested as a feature decoupled from convection. Using a cloud-resolving model, the authors demonstrate that convection, in fact, has a cooling effect in the TTL that significantly affects its thermal structure. In particular, the cold point is found to be strongly tied to the convective cooling maximum. The authors interpret these as natural features of an entrainment layer such as the TTL. The recognition that the cold point tropopause is strongly tied to, rather than decoupled from, convection suggests that dehydration processes at the cold point cannot be assumed as gradual and the effect of convection may not be ignored.},

abstract = {The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are expected to be in long-term radiation balance: an increase in the absorption of solar radiation warms the surface and troposphere, which leads to a matching increase in the emission of thermal radiation. Warming a wet planet such as Earth would make the atmosphere moist and optically thick such that only thermal radiation emitted from the upper troposphere can escape to space. Hence, for a hot moist atmosphere, there is an upper limit on the thermal emission that is unrelated to surface temperature. If the solar radiation absorbed exceeds this limit, the planet will heat uncontrollably and the entire ocean will evaporate—the so-called runaway greenhouse. Here we model the solar and thermal radiative transfer in incipient and complete runaway greenhouse atmospheres at line-by-line spectral resolution using amodern spectral database.We find a thermal radiation limit of 282Wm−2 (lower than previously reported) and that 294Wm−2 of solar radiation is absorbed (higher than previously reported).Therefore, a steamatmosphere induced by such a runaway greenhouse may be a stable state for a planet receiving a similar amount of solar radiation as Earth today. Avoiding a runaway greenhouse on Earth requires that the atmosphere is subsaturated withwater, and that the albedo effect of clouds exceeds their greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing, but anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional, radiative-convective model is used to study the equilibria conditions of moist atmospheres. We show that when the hydrologic cycle is included in the model a subcritical bifurcation occurs, leading to 2 linearly stable solutions to the radiative-convective equilibria. In this case, when the net forcing is larger than a critical value, two equilibria are possible. Furthermore, a finite amplitude instability can lead to a runaway greenhouse regime when the solar forcing is larger than a second critical value. In general, previous climate studies with radiative-convective models did not include a hydrologic cycle. Instead, the atmosphere's water vapor mixing ratio was diagnosed based on the climatological profile of relative humidity. We show that fixing the water vapor relative humidity profile at the climatological value (in the computation of the radiation fluxes only) leads to a unique stable solution to the radiative-convective equilibria. Thus, the crucial part of the hydrologic cycle which allows multiple solutions is the relaxation of the assumption of a climatological relative humidity profile. Our results do not apply directly to any real planet because of large uncertainties in our calculation due to the absence of clouds and the use of a one-dimensional model. The Ist equilibrium corresponds to an optically thin atmosphere. In this regime, the system Is nearly linear and is in a state of small dissipation. The 2nd equilibrium corresponds to an optically thick atmosphere. In this 2nd regime, the system is highly nonlinear and is in a state of large dissipation.},

abstract = {Using a passive tracer, entrainment is studied in cloud-resolving simulations of oceanic deep convection in radiative-convective equilibrium. It is found that the convective flux of undiluted parcels decays with height exponentially, indicating a constant probability per vertical distance of mixing with environmental air. This probability per distance is sufficiently large that undiluted updrafts are negligible above a height of 4-5 kilometers and virtually absent above 10 kilometers. These results are shown to be independent of the horizontal grid size within the range of 3.2 kilometers to 100 meters. Plumes that do reach the tropopause are found to be highly diluted. An equivalent potential temperature is defined that is exactly conserved for all adiabatic transformations, including those with ice. Using this conserved variable, the density of adiabatic parcels with and without fusion can be calculated. When an adiabatic parcel is taken to sufficiently low pressures, the effect of fusion is to make the parcel more dense, not less; at the slightly higher pressures corresponding to the tropopause, the effect of fusion on buoyancy is negligible. Nevertheless, the contribution from fusion to an adiabatic parcel's kinetic energy is quite large. Using an ensemble of tracers, it is shown how information can be encoded in parcels at the cloud base and decoded where the parcel is observed in the free troposphere. Using this technique, tropospheric clouds can be diagnosed for their cloud-base temperature, specific humidity, and vertical velocity. Using these as the initial values for a Lagrangian parcel model, it is shown that fusion provides the kinetic energy required for diluted parcels to reach the tropopause.},

Results from these simulations indicate that, while the SCM–convective wake scheme combination generally produced long-lasting squall/wake systems, the wakes were often too shallow, too warm, and too moist.

In contrast, the leading edge of this cold air lifts unstable environmental air helping to trigger new convection. A GCM cannot resolve the disturbed and undisturbed regions explicitly, so some parameterizations of these critical mesoscale phenomena are needed. The simplest approaches are to either instantly mix downdraft air with the environment, or instantly recover the downdraft air. The instant-mixing approach tends to lead to unrealistic pulsing of convection in environments that would otherwise be able to support long-lived mesoscale convective systems while the instant recovery approach usually overestimates surface energy fluxes.

abstract = {Recent studies have modelled the flow of particle-driven gravity currents over horizontal boundaries using either shallow-water equations or simple box' (integral) models. The shallow-water equations are typically integrated numerically, whereas box models admit analytical solutions. However, the theoretical validity of the latter models has not been fully established. In this paper a novel mathematical technique is developed which permits the derivation of analytical solutions to the shallow-water model for gravity current motion. These solutions, confirmed by comparison with the results of numerical integration, are in good agreement with experimental observations. They also indicate why the simplified box models have been so successful. Moreover, they reveal how the internal dynamics of particle-driven flows are different from gravity currents arising solely due to compositional density differences. While compositionally driven gravity currents, which have a fixed density difference between the intruding and ambient fluids, may be modelled using similarity solutions to the governing equations, particle-driven gravity currents do not possess such solutions because their density is progressively reduced by particle sedimentation. Instead the new analysis determines how their behaviour progressively diverges from the similarity solution. By a change of independent variables, it is possible to develop convergent series expansions for each of the dependent variables which characterize the motion. It is suggested that this approach may find application to a number of other problems in which the dynamics are initially governed by a simple dynamical balance which is progressively lost as extra physical effects begin to influence the motion.},

The budget equations for mass, energy, and water yield evolution equations for the prognostic variables (the vertical profiles of the temperature and humidity differences between the wakes and their exterior). They also provide additional terms for the equations of the mean variables. The driving terms of the wake equations are the differential heating and drying due to convective drafts. The action of the convection on the wakes is implemented by splitting the convective tendency and attributing the effect of the precip...},

Differences among models are primarily at intermediate CWV where the transition from shallow to deeper convection occurs.

Vertical structure is truncated at two modes, excited by convective (one-signed) and stratiform (two-signed) heating processes in tropical deep convection. Separate treatments of deep and shallow convection are justified by observations that deep convection is more variable. Deep convection intensity is assumed to be modulated by convective available potential energy (CAPE), while occurrence frequency is modulated by the ratio of convective inhibition (CIN) to “triggering energy” K, a scalar representing the intensity of subgrid-scale fluctuations. Deep convective downdrafts cool and dry the boundary layer but also increase K. Variations of K make the relationship between convection and thermodynamic variables (CAPE, CIN, $\theta$e) nonunique and amplify the deep convective response to temperature waves of small (∼1°C) am...},

The statistical analysis methodologies that are used do not require tracing the history of individual clouds or air parcels; instead they rely on probing the ensemble characteristics of cumulus convection in the large model dataset. They appear to be an attractive way for analyzing outputs from cloud-resolving numerical experiments. Throughout the simulation, it is found that 1) the initial thermodynamic properties of the updrafts at the cloud base have rather tight distributions; 2) contrary to the assumption made in many cumulus schemes, nearly undiluted air parcels are too infrequent to be relevant to any stage of the simulated convection; and 3) a ...},

In this paper we describe a new experimental technique to determine the density structure of gravity currents, and present some results for the lock-release case. We find that substantial mixing occurs in the early stages of the evolution of lock-release gravity currents and that this mixing leads to the formation of a complex internal density structure. Mixed fluid is produced across the concentration range and we examine the mixing rates. By contrasting three experiments with different lock aspect ratios, we examine the effect of the aspect ratio of the release on the subsequent evolution of the flow.},

With the enhanced grid resolution, the low-level cyclonic vorticity increases dramatically, and the gust front rapidly occludes as small-scale downdrafts develop in the vicinity of the low-level center of circulation. As the occlusion progresses, a ring of high-vorticity air surrounds the circulation center and could be conducive to multiple vortex tornado formation. Numerous features of the simulated transition bear resemblance to those observed in tornadic storms. In the model simulation, the large low-level vorticity is generated through the tilting and intense stretching of air from the inflow side of the storm. This vertical vorticity is derived from the horizontal vorticity of the environmental shear and also from horizontal vorticity generated solenoidally as low-l...},

An “optimal” state was proposed by RKW, based on the relative strength of the circulation associated with the storm-generated cold pool and the circulation associated with the ambient shear, whereby the deepest leading edge lifting and most effective convective retriggering occurred when these circulations were in near balance. Since this work, subsequent studies have brought into question the basic validity of the proposed optimal state, based on concerns as to the appropriate distribution of shear relative to the cold pool for optimal lifting, as well as the relevance of such concepts to fully complex squall lines, especially considering the...},

@article{Bloch-Johnson2015,
abstract = {The long-term warming from an anthropogenic increase in atmospheric CO2 is often assumed to be proportional to the forcing associated with that increase. This paper examines this linear approximation using a zero-dimensional energy balance model with a temperature-dependent feedback, with parameter values drawn from physical arguments and general circulation models. For a positive feedback temperature dependence, warming increases Earth's sensitivity, while greater sensitivity makes Earth warm more. These effects can feed on each other, greatly amplifying warming. As a result, for reasonable values of feedback temperature dependence and preindustrial feedback, Earth can jump to a warmer state under only one or two CO2 doublings. The linear approximation breaks down in the long tail of high climate sensitivity commonly seen in observational studies. Understanding feedback temperature dependence is therefore essential for inferring the risk of high warming from modern observations. Studies that assume linearity likely underestimate the risk of high warming.},

abstract = {This paper discusses the possible response of the large-scale atmospheric structure to a warmer climate. Using integrations from the fifth phase of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) in conjunction with physical arguments, we try to identify what changes are likely to be robust and what the underlying mechanisms might be. We focus on the large-scale zonally-averaged circulation, in particular on height of the tropopause, the strength and position of the surface westerlies and the strength and extent of the Hadley Cell. We present analytic arguments and numerical calculations that suggest that under global warming the height of the tropopause will increase in both the transient response and final equilibrium state, and an increase is clearly found in all the comprehensive models in CMIP5. Upper stratospheric cooling is also found in the comprehensive models, and this too can be explained by a radiative argument. Regarding the circulation, most models show a slight expansion and weakening of the Hadley Cell, depending on season and hemisphere. The expansion is small and largely confined to winter but with some expansion in Southern Hemisphere summer. The weakening occurs principally in Northern Hemisphere but the intermodel scatter is large. There is also a general polewards shift in surface westerlies, but the changes are small and again are little larger than the inter-model variability in the change. This shift is positively correlated with the Hadley Cell expansion to a degree that depends somewhat on the metric chosen for the latter. There is a robust strengthening in the Southern Hemisphere surface winds across seasons. In the Northern Hemisphere there is a slight strengthening in the westerlies in most models in winter but a consistent weakening of the westerlies in summer. We present various physical arguments concerning these circulation changes but none that are both demonstrably correct and that account for the model results. We conclude that the above-mentioned large-scale thermodynamic/radiative changes in the large-scale atmospheric structure are generally robust, in the sense of being both well understood and consistently reproduced by comprehensive models. In that sense the dynamical changes are less robust given the current state of knowledge and simulation, although one cannot conclude that they are, in principle, unknowable or less predictable.},

abstract = {This paper presents a detailed study of a single thunderstorm anvil cirrus cloud measured on 21 July 2002 near southern Florida during the Cirrus Regional Study of Tropical Anvils and Cirrus Layers-Florida Area Cirrus Experiment (CRYSTAL-FACE). NASA WB-57F and University of North Dakota Citation aircraft tracked the microphysical and radiative development of the anvil for 3 h. Measurements showed that the cloud mass that was advected downwind from the thunderstorm was separated vertically into two layers: a cirrus anvil with cloud-top temperatures of -45 degrees C lay below a second, thin tropopause cirrus (TTC) layer with the same horizontal dimensions as the anvil and temperatures near -70 degrees C. In both cloud layers, ice crystals smaller than 50 mu m across dominated the size distributions and cloud radiative properties. In the anvil, ice crystals larger than 50 mu m aggregated and precipitated while small ice crystals increasingly dominated the size distributions; as a consequence, measured ice water contents and ice crystal effective radii decreased with time. Meanwhile, the anvil thinned vertically and maintained a stratification similar to its environment. Because effective radii were small, radiative heating and cooling were concentrated in layers approximately 100 m thick at the anvil top and base. A simple analysis suggests that the anvil cirrus spread laterally because mixing in these radiatively driven layers created horizontal pressure gradients between the cloud and its stratified environment. The TTC layer also spread but, unlike the anvil, did not dissipate-perhaps because the anvil shielded the TTC from terrestrial infrared heating. Calculations of top-of-troposphere radiative forcing above the anvil and TTC showed strong cooling that tapered as the anvil evolved.},

This study contributes to the ongoing debate of the physical reasons for this difference, through the use of the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) Precipitation Feature (PF) database. We demonstrate that tropical oceanic PFs with lightning tend to be over 10 times larger and more mature than those over land. This relationship is most pronounced in archetypal land and ocean regimes (Congo and Central Pacific) and is also manifested throughout the entire (35°S to 35°N) TRMM domain, to varying extents. This relationship holds true when we select for PFs with 40 dBZ echo tops over at least 5.5 km in height, which continues to be an effective proxy for convective intensity and probability of lightning.},

abstract = {This paper discusses common modes of mesoscale convective organization. Using 2-km national composite reflectivity data, the authors investigated linear mesoscale convective systems (MCSs) that occurred in the central United States during May 1996 and May 1997. Based upon the radar-observed characteristics of 88 linear MCSs, the authors propose a new taxonomy comprising convective lines with trailing (TS), leading (LS), and parallel (PS) stratiform precipitation. While the TS archetype was found to be the dominant mode of linear MCS organization, the LS and PS archetypes composed nearly 40{\%} of the studied population. In this paper, the authors document the characteristics of each linear MCS class and use operational surface and upper air data to describe their different environments. In particular, wind profiler data reveal that the stratiform precipitation arrangement associated with each class was roughly consistent with the advection of hydrometeors implied by the mean middle- and upper-tropospheric storm-relative winds, which were significantly different among the three MCS modes. Case study examples are presented for both the LS and PS classes, which have received relatively little attention to this point.

abstract = {A method is introduced for directly measuring convective entrainment and detrainment in a cloud-resolving simulation. This technique is used to quantify the errors in the entrainment and detrainment estimates obtained using the standard bulk-plume method. The bulk-plume method diagnoses these rates from the convective flux of some conserved tracer, such as total water in nonprecipitating convection. By not accounting for the variability of this tracer in clouds and in the environment, it is argued that the bulk-plume equations systematically underestimate entrainment. Using tracers with different vertical profiles, it is also shown that the bulk-plume estimates are tracer dependent and, in some cases, unphysical. The new direct-measurement technique diagnoses entrainment and detrainment at the gridcell level without any recourse to conserved tracers. Using this method in large-eddy simulations of shallow and deep convection, it is found that the bulk-plume method underestimates entrainment by roughly a factor of 2. The directly measured entrainment rates are then compared to cloud height and cloud buoyancy. Contrary to existing theories, fractional entrainment is not found to scale like the inverse of height, the cloud buoyancy, or the gradient of cloud buoyancy. On the other hand, fractional detrainment is found to scale linearly with cloud buoyancy. Finally, direct measurement is used to diagnose the spatial distribution of entrainment and detrainment during the evolution of an individual deep cumulonimbus.},

The range of scenarios considered is extremely broad, however, and this is a primary source of forecast uncertainty. Here, it is shown both theoretically and observationally how the evolution of the human system can be considered from a surprisingly simple thermodynamic perspective in which it is unnecessary to explicitly model two of the emissions drivers: population and standard of living. Specifically, the human system grows through a self-perpetuating feedback loop in which the consumption rate of primary energy resources stays tied to the historical accumulation of global economic production - or p times g - through a time-independent factor of 9.7 +/- 0.3 milliwatts per inflation-adjusted 1990 US dollar. This important constraint, and the fact that f and c have historically varied rather slowly, points towards substantially narrowed visions of future emissions scenarios for implementation in GCMs.},

To first order this consists of a shift to warmer temperatures as climate warms, without change of shape of the PDF. The behavior is tied to a shift of the temperature for deep convection onset. Consequently, the threshold for appearance of high clouds and associated radiative forcing shifts along with temperature. An excess entropy coordinate provides a reference to which the onset of deep convection is invariant, and gives a compact description of SST changes and cloud feedbacks suitable for diagnostics and as a basis for simplified climate models. The results underscore that the typically skewed appearance of tropical SST histograms, with a sharp drop-off above some threshold value, should not be taken as evidence for tropical thermostats.},

abstract = {The atmospheres of terrestrial planets are expected to be in long-term radiation balance: an increase in the absorption of solar radiation warms the surface and troposphere, which leads to a matching increase in the emission of thermal radiation. Warming a wet planet such as Earth would make the atmosphere moist and optically thick such that only thermal radiation emitted from the upper troposphere can escape to space. Hence, for a hot moist atmosphere, there is an upper limit on the thermal emission that is unrelated to surface temperature. If the solar radiation absorbed exceeds this limit, the planet will heat uncontrollably and the entire ocean will evaporate—the so-called runaway greenhouse. Here we model the solar and thermal radiative transfer in incipient and complete runaway greenhouse atmospheres at line-by-line spectral resolution using amodern spectral database.We find a thermal radiation limit of 282Wm−2 (lower than previously reported) and that 294Wm−2 of solar radiation is absorbed (higher than previously reported).Therefore, a steamatmosphere induced by such a runaway greenhouse may be a stable state for a planet receiving a similar amount of solar radiation as Earth today. Avoiding a runaway greenhouse on Earth requires that the atmosphere is subsaturated withwater, and that the albedo effect of clouds exceeds their greenhouse effect. A runaway greenhouse could in theory be triggered by increased greenhouse forcing, but anthropogenic emissions are probably insufficient.},

Using a cloud-resolving model, the authors demonstrate that convection, in fact, has a cooling effect in the TTL that significantly affects its thermal structure. In particular, the cold point is found to be strongly tied to the convective cooling maximum. The authors interpret these as natural features of an entrainment layer such as the TTL. The recognition that the cold point tropopause is strongly tied to, rather than decoupled from, convection suggests that dehydration processes at the cold point cannot be assumed as gradual and the effect of convection may not be ignored.},

abstract = {A one-dimensional, radiative-convective model is used to study the equilibria conditions of moist atmospheres. We show that when the hydrologic cycle is included in the model a subcritical bifurcation occurs, leading to 2 linearly stable solutions to the radiative-convective equilibria. In this case, when the net forcing is larger than a critical value, two equilibria are possible. Furthermore, a finite amplitude instability can lead to a runaway greenhouse regime when the solar forcing is larger than a second critical value. In general, previous climate studies with radiative-convective models did not include a hydrologic cycle. Instead, the atmosphere's water vapor mixing ratio was diagnosed based on the climatological profile of relative humidity. We show that fixing the water vapor relative humidity profile at the climatological value (in the computation of the radiation fluxes only) leads to a unique stable solution to the radiative-convective equilibria. Thus, the crucial part of the hydrologic cycle which allows multiple solutions is the relaxation of the assumption of a climatological relative humidity profile. Our results do not apply directly to any real planet because of large uncertainties in our calculation due to the absence of clouds and the use of a one-dimensional model. The Ist equilibrium corresponds to an optically thin atmosphere. In this regime, the system Is nearly linear and is in a state of small dissipation. The 2nd equilibrium corresponds to an optically thick atmosphere. In this 2nd regime, the system is highly nonlinear and is in a state of large dissipation.},

abstract = {Radiative-moist-convective equilibrium (RCE) is a simple paradigm for the statistical equilibrium the earth's climate would exhibit in the absence of lateral energy transport. It has generally been assumed that for a given solar forcing and long-lived greenhouse gas concentration, such a state would be unique, but recent work suggests that more than one stable equilibrium may be possible. Here we show that above a critical specified sea surface temperature, the ordinary RCE state becomes linearly unstable to large-scale overturning circulations. The instability migrates the RCE state toward one of the two stable equilibria first found by Raymond and Zeng (2000). It occurs when the clear-sky infrared opacity of the lower troposphere becomes so large, owing to high water vapor concentration, that variations of the radiative cooling of the lower troposphere are governed principally by variations in upper tropospheric water vapor. We show that the instability represents a subcritical bifurcation of the ordinary RCE state, leading to either a dry state with large-scale descent, or to a moist state with mean ascent; these states may be accessed by finite amplitude perturbations to ordinary RCE in the subcritical state, or spontaneously in the supercritical state. As first suggested by Raymond (2000) and Sobel et al. (2007), the latter corresponds to the phenomenon of self-aggregation of moist convection, taking the form of cloud clusters or tropical cyclones. We argue that the nonrobustness of self-aggregation in cloud system resolving models may be an artifact of running such models close to the critical temperature for instability.},

The value of 40 W m-2 was estimated in an ad hoc manner. A more detailed calculation of this component, termed here the Surface Transmitted Irradiance (STI), is presented, using a line-by-line radiation code and 3-D climatologies of temperature, humidity, cloudiness etc. No assumption is made as to the wavelengths at which radiation from the surface can reach the top of the atmosphere. The role of the water vapor continuum is highlighted. In clear skies, if the continuum is excluded, the global and annual-mean STI is calculated to be about 100 W m-2 with a broad maximum throughout the tropics and sub-tropics. When the continuum is included, the clear-sky STI is reduced to 66 W m-2, with a distinctly different geographic distribution, with a minimum in the tropics and local peaks over sub-tropical deserts. The inclusion of clouds reduces the STI to about 22 W m-2. The actual value is likely somewhat smaller due to processes neglected here, and an STI value of 20 W m-2 (with an estimated uncertainty of about 20{\%}) is suggested to be much more realistic than the previous estimate of 40 W m-2. This indicates that less than one-tenth of the OLR originates directly from the surface.},

abstract = {Intensification of the hydrologic cycle is a key dimension of climate change, with substantial impacts on human and natural systems. A basic measure of hydrologic cycle intensification is the increase in global-mean precipitation per unit surface warming, which varies by a factor of three in current-generation climate models (about 1-3 per cent per kelvin). Part of the uncertainty may originate from atmosphere-radiation interactions. As the climate warms, increases in shortwave absorption from atmospheric moistening will suppress the precipitation increase. This occurs through a reduction of the latent heating increase required to maintain a balanced atmospheric energy budget. Using an ensemble of climate models, here we show that such models tend to underestimate the sensitivity of solar absorption to variations in atmospheric water vapour, leading to an underestimation in the shortwave absorption increase and an overestimation in the precipitation increase. This sensitivity also varies considerably among models due to differences in radiative transfer parameterizations, explaining a substantial portion of model spread in the precipitation response. Consequently, attaining accurate shortwave absorption responses through improvements to the radiative transfer schemes could reduce the spread in the predicted global precipitation increase per degree warming for the end of the twenty-first century by about 35 per cent, and reduce the estimated ensemble-mean increase in this quantity by almost 40 per cent.},

abstract = {AbstractTropical deep convection exhibits complex organization over a wide range of scales. This study investigates the relationships between the spatial organization of deep convection and the large-scale atmospheric state. By using several satellite datasets and reanalyses, and by defining a simple diagnostic of convective aggregation, relationships between the degree of convective aggregation and the amount of water vapor, turbulent surface fluxes, and radiation are highlighted above tropical oceans. When deep convection is more aggregated, the middle and upper troposphere are drier in the convection-free environment, turbulent surface fluxes are enhanced, and the low-level and midlevel cloudiness is reduced in the environment. Humidity and cloudiness changes lead to a large increase in outgoing longwave radiation. Cloud changes also result in reduced reflected shortwave radiation. Owing to these opposing effects, the sensitivity of the radiative budget at the top of the atmosphere to convective aggreg...},

abstract = {Equilibrium climate sensitivity to a doubling of CO2 falls between 2.0 and 4.6 K in current climate models, and they suggest a weak increase in global mean precipitation. Inferences from the observational record, however, place climate sensitivity near the lower end of this range and indicate that models underestimate some of the changes in the hydrological cycle. These discrepancies raise the possibility that important feedbacks are missing from the models. A controversial hypothesis suggests that the dry and clear regions of the tropical atmosphere expand in a warming climate and thereby allow more infrared radiation to escape to space. This so-called iris effect could constitute a negative feedback that is not included in climate models. We find that inclusion of such an effect in a climate model moves the simulated responses of both temperature and the hydrological cycle to rising atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations closer to observations. Alternative suggestions for shortcomings of models [mdash] such as aerosol cooling, volcanic eruptions or insufficient ocean heat uptake [mdash] may explain a slow observed transient warming relative to models, but not the observed enhancement of the hydrological cycle. We propose that, if precipitating convective clouds are more likely to cluster into larger clouds as temperatures rise, this process could constitute a plausible physical mechanism for an iris effect.},

abstract = {The water vapour feedback probably makes the largest contribution to climate sensitivity, and the second-largest contribution to its uncertainty, in the sense of disagreement between General Circulation Models (GCMs, the most physically detailed models of climate we have). Yet there has been no quantification of it which allows these differences to be attributed physically with the aim of constraining the true value. This paper develops a new breakdown of the non-cloud LW (longwave) response to climate change, which avoids the problems of the conventional breakdown, and applies it to a set of 4 GCMs. The basic physical differences are that temperature is used as the vertical coordinate, and relative humidity as the humidity variable. In this framework the different GCMs' feedbacks look more alike, consistent with our understanding that their water vapour responses are physically very similar. Also, in the global mean all the feedback components have the same sign, allowing us to conveniently attribute the overall response fractionally (e.g. about 60{\%} from the "partly-Simpsonian" component). The systematic cancellation between different feedback components in the conventional breakdown is lost, so now a difference in a feedback component actually contributes to a difference in climate sensitivity, and the differences between these GCMs in the non-cloud LW part of this can be traced to differences in formulation, mean climate and climate change response. Physical effects such as those due to variations in the formulation of LW radiative transfer become visible. Differences in the distribution of warming no longer dominate comparison of GCMs. The largest component depends locally only on the GCM's mean climate, so it can in principle be calculated for the real world and validated. However, components dependent on the climate change response probably account for most of the variation between GCMs. The effect of simply changing the humidity variable in the conventional breakdown is also examined. It gives some of this improvement-the loss of the cancellations that leave the conventional breakdown of no use to understand differences between GCMs' climate sensitivities-but not the link to mean climate.},

They have also been invoked as responsible for balancing surface latent and sensible heat fluxes in the heat and moisture budget of tropical boundary layers. This study is focused on precipitation-driven downdrafts and basic aspects of their dynamics in a case of radiative–convective equilibrium. Using Lagrangian particle tracking, it is shown that such downdrafts have very low initial heights, with most parcels originating within 1.5 km from the surface. The tracking is also used to compute the contribution of downdrafts to the flux of moist static energy at the top of the boundary layer, and it is found that this is on the same order of magnitude as the contribution due to convective updrafts, but much smaller than that due to turbulent mixing across the boundary layer top in the environment. Furthermore, considering the mechanisms driving the downdrafts, it is shown that the work done by rain evaporation is less than half that done by condensate loading.},

abstract = {AbstractThis study investigates how precipitation-driven cold pools aid the formation of wider clouds that are essential for a transition from shallow to deep convection. In connection with a temperature depression and a depletion of moisture inside developing cold pools, an accumulation of moisture in moist patches around the cold pools is observed. Convective clouds are formed on top of these moist patches. Larger moist patches form with time supporting more and larger clouds. Moreover, enhanced vertical lifting along the leading edges of the gravity current triggered by the cold pool is found. The interplay of moisture aggregation and lifting eventually promotes the formation of wider clouds that are less affected by entrainment and become deeper. These mechanisms are corroborated in a series of cloud-resolving model simulations representing different atmospheric environments. A positive feedback is observed in that, in an atmosphere in which cloud and rain formation is facilitated, stronger downdrafts will form. These stronger downdrafts lead to a stronger modification of the moisture field, which in turn favors further cloud development. This effect is not only observed in the transition phase but also active in prolonging the peak time of precipitation in the later stages of the diurnal cycle. These findings are used to propose a simple way for incorporating the effect of cold pools on cloud sizes and thereby entrainment rate into parameterization schemes for convection. Comparison of this parameterization to the cloud-resolving modeling output gives promising results.},

abstract = {The problem of intense, truncation-scale storms that form in high-resolution versions of the Community Atmosphere Model Version 4 (CAM4) is studied. These storms are characterized by extreme vertical motion and heavy precipitation. This problem arises when some individual parametrizations do not produce an atmospheric-like state because they are restrained by the time-scales assumed in their formulation; other unconstrained parametrizations that follow then work in unintended ways. The behaviour of the moist parametrization components is examined in CAM4 for one typical, strong cell. At T340 spectral truncation with a 5 min time step, the deep and shallow convection parametrizations do not remove instabilities and supersaturation because they have time-scales of 1 h and 30 min, respectively. Then the prognostic cloud-water scheme, which is not constrained by a time-scale, does remove supersaturation. That local release of latent heat drives very strong vertical motion and horizontal convergence, which transports even more water vapour into the column, exacerbating the problem. Two simple model problems are introduced that illustrate the ramifications of the time-scale and time-step mismatch. When either the time-scales are shortened or the time step is lengthened, the convection parametrizations are more active and strong storms do not form.

abstract = {Climate sensitivity is often said to be doubled by water vapour feedback. We expect the distribution of relative humidity to change little under climate change from simple physical arguments, which are confirmed by the most detailed physical models we have, and consistent with the limited observational evidence. A substantial positive feedback on climate change is then to be expected, and an approximate doubling is well established numerically. However, a physical explanation for the size of this effect is conspicuously lacking. We consider an idealized numerical model of Simpson's. Its counter-intuitive result that OLR does not change as climate warms is shown to be more general than often thought, though clearly not applicable to our planet as it stands. However, with certain physical approximations a partly-Simpsonian generalization can be derived: that the component radiated by water vapour does not change as the climate system warms, while that radiated by everything else increases following Planck's Law. While still not quantitatively accurate, this does provide a physical explanation for the general size of the water vapour feedback, as well as for its robustness in GCMs. The partly-Simpsonian approach also provides a physical explanation for the well-established fact that, in water-vapour-dominated regions of the spectrum, the heat radiated by the climate system is a function primarily of relative humidity, not temperature.

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

In 1997, Kiehl and Trenberth provided a review of past estimates and performed a number of radiative computations to better establish the role of clouds and various greenhouse gases in the overall radiative energy flows, with top-of-atmosphere (TOA) values constrained by Earth Radiation Budget Experiment values from 1985 to 1989, when the TOA values were approximately in balance. The Clouds and the Earth's Radiant Energy System (CERES) measurements from March 2000 to May 2004 are used at TOA but adjusted to an estimated imbalance from the enhanced greenhouse effect of 0.9 W m−2. Revised estimates of surface turbulent fluxes are made based on various sources. The partitioning of solar radiation in the atmosphere is based in part on the International Satellite Cloud Climatology Project (ISCCP) FD computations that utilize the global ISCCP cloud data every 3 h, and also accounts for increased atmospheric absorption by water vapor and aerosols. Surface upward longwave radiation is adjusted to account for spatial and temporal variability. A lack of closure in the energy balance at the surface is accommodated by making modest changes to surface fluxes, with the downward longwave radiation as the main residual to ensure a balance. Values are also presented for the land and ocean domains that include a net transport of energy from ocean to land of 2.2 petawatts (PW) of which 3.2 PW is from moisture (latent energy) transport, while net dry static energy transport is from land to ocean.

This framework allows an investigation of the sensitivity of the storm to changes in without complications from differences in storm initiation and early evolution. The restarted simulations reach a quasi steady state within approximately 1 h. Results demonstrate that there are two -dependent regimes with the transition between regimes occurring for between 250 and 500 m. Some storm characteristics, such as the mean convective core area, change substantially for 250 m but show limited sensitivity as is decreased below 250 m, despite better resolving smaller-scale turbulent motions. This transition is found to be independent of the chosen . Mixing in the context of varying and is also investigated via passive tracers that are initialized 1 h after restarting the simulations (i.e., after the spin up of small-scale motions). The tracer field at the end of the simulations reveals that entrainment and detrainment are suppressed in the simulations with 500 m. For decreasing , entrainment and detrainment are substantially more important, limiting the flux of low-level tracer to the upper troposphere, which has important implications for modeling studies of convective transport from the boundary layer through the troposphere.},

To provide a clear theoretical framework for the problem, techniques for simulating turbulent flows are reviewed, and the source of the subgrid terms in the Navier–Stokes equation is clarified. For decades, cloud-resolving models have used large-eddy simulation (LES) techniques to parameterize the subgrid terms. A literature review suggests that the appropriateness of using traditional LES closures for this purpose has never been established. Furthermore, examination of the assumptions inherent in these closures suggests that grid spacing on the order of 100 m may be required for the performance of cloud models to be consistent with their design. Based on these arguments, numerical simulations of squall lines were conducted with grid spacings between 1 km and 125 m. The results reveal that simulations with 1-km grid spacing do not produce equivalent squall-line structure and ...},

abstract = {SUMMARY ERA-40 is a re-analysis of meteorological observations from September 1957 to August 2002 produced by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) in collaboration with many institutions. The observing system changed considerably over this re-analysis period, with assimilable data provided by a succession of satellite-borne instruments from the 1970s onwards, supplemented by increasing numbers of observations from aircraft, ocean-buoys and other surface platforms, but with a declining number of radiosonde ascents since the late 1980s. The observations used in ERA-40 were accumulated from many sources. The first part of this paper describes the data acquisition and the principal changes in data type and coverage over the period. It also describes the data assimilation system used for ERA-40. This benefited from many of the changes introduced into operational forecasting since the mid-1990s, when the systems used for the 15-year ECMWF re-analysis (ERA-15) and the National Centers for Environmental Prediction/National Center for Atmospheric Research (NCEP/NCAR) re-analysis were implemented. Several of the improvements are discussed. General aspects of the production of the analyses are also summarized. A number of results indicative of the overall performance of the data assimilation system, and implicitly of the observing system, are presented and discussed. The comparison of background (short-range) forecasts and analyses with observations, the consistency of the global mass budget, the magnitude of differences between analysis and background fields and the accuracy of medium-range forecasts run from the ERA-40 analyses are illustrated.

In contrast, the synoptic quality of the analysis for the northern hemisphere is sufficient to provide forecasts that remain skilful well into the medium range for all years. Two particular problems are also examined: excessive precipitation over tropical oceans and a too strong Brewer–Dobson circulation, both of which are pronounced in later years. Several other aspects of the quality of the re-analyses revealed by monitoring and validation studies are summarized.

The shift of the storm tracks is accompanied by a poleward shift and upward expansion of the midlatitude baroclinic regions associated with enhanced warming in the tropical upper troposphere and increased tropopause height. The poleward shift in baroclinicity is augmented in the Southern Hemisphere and partially offset in the Northern Hemisphere by changes in the surface meridional temperature gradient. The poleward shift of the storm tracks also tends to be accompanied by poleward shifts in surface wind stress and precipitation, and a shift towards the high index state of the annular modes.

abstract = {[1] It is now apparent that observed increases in stratospheric water vapor may have contributed significantly to both stratospheric cooling and tropospheric warming over the last few decades. However, a recent study has suggested that our initial estimate of the climate impact may have overestimated both the radiative forcing and stratospheric cooling from these changes. We show that differences between the various estimates are not due to inherent problems with broadband and narrow-band radiation schemes but rather due to the different experimental setups, particularly the altitude of the water vapor change relative to the tropopause used in the radiative calculations. Furthermore, we show that if recent estimates for the observed water vapor trends are valid globally they could have contributed a radiative forcing of up to 0.29 Wm(-2) and a lower-stratospheric cooling of more than 0.8 K over the past 20 years, with these values more than doubling if, as has been suggested, the trend has persisted for the last 40 years. This 40 year radiative forcing is roughly 75{\%} of that due to carbon dioxide alone but, despite its high value, we find that the addition of this forcing into a simple model of climate change still gives global mean surface temperature trends which are consistent with observations.},

abstract = {The IPSL-CM5A climate model was used to perform a large number of control, historical and climate change simulations in the frame of CMIP5. The refined horizontal and vertical grid of the atmospheric component, LMDZ, constitutes a major difference compared to the previous IPSL-CM4 version used for CMIP3. From imposed-SST (Sea Surface Temperature) and coupled numerical experiments, we systematically analyze the impact of the horizontal and vertical grid resolution on the simulated climate. The refinement of the horizontal grid results in a systematic reduction of major biases in the mean tropospheric structures and SST. The mid-latitude jets, located too close to the equator with the coarsest grids, move poleward. This robust feature, is accompanied by a drying at mid-latitudes and a reduction of cold biases in mid-latitudes relative to the equator. The model was also extended to the stratosphere by increasing the number of layers on the vertical from 19 to 39 (15 in the stratosphere) and adding relevant parameterizations. The 39-layer version captures the dominant modes of the stratospheric variability and exhibits stratospheric sudden warmings. Changing either the vertical or horizontal resolution modifies the global energy balance in imposed-SST simulations by typically several W/m2 which translates in the coupled atmosphere-ocean simulations into a different global-mean SST. The sensitivity is of about 1.2 K per 1 W/m2 when varying the horizontal grid. A re-tuning of model parameters was thus required to restore this energy balance in the imposed-SST simulations and reduce the biases in the simulated mean surface temperature and, to some extent, latitudinal SST variations in the coupled experiments for the modern climate. The tuning hardly compensates, however, for robust biases of the coupled model. Despite the wide range of grid configurations explored and their significant impact on the present-day climate, the climate sensitivity remains essentially unchanged.},

We present a simple model for the moisture budget of the free troposphere, including subsidence drying, convective moistening, and horizontal mixing, and a constraint on total precipitation representing radiative-convective equilibrium. When initialized with a spatially uncorrelated moisture distribution, the model shows self-organization of precipitation with two main stages: A coarsening stage where the correlation length grows proportional to time to the power 1/2 and a droplet stage where precipitation is confined to a decreasing number of circular moist regions. A potential function is introduced to characterize the tendency for self-organization, which could be a useful diagnostic for analyzing cloud-resolving model simulations.},

abstract = {How tropical low clouds change with climate remains the dominant source of uncertainty in global warming projections. An analysis of an ensemble of CMIP5 climate models reveals that a significant part of the spread in the models' climate sensitivity can be accounted by differences in the climatological shallowness of tropical low clouds in weak-subsidence regimes: models with shallower low clouds in weak-subsidence regimes tend to have a higher climate sensitivity than models with deeper low clouds. The dynamical mechanisms responsible for the model differences are analyzed. Competing effects of parameterized boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are found to be essential. Boundary-layer turbulence and shallow convection are typically represented by distinct parameterization schemes in current models—parameterization schemes that often produce opposing effects on low clouds. Convective drying of the boundary layer tends to deepen low clouds and reduce the cloud fraction at the lowest levels; turbulent moistening tends to make low clouds more shallow but affects the low-cloud fraction less. The relative importance different models assign to these opposing mechanisms contributes to the spread of the climatological shallowness of low clouds and thus to the spread of low-cloud changes under global warming.},

The primary focus of this paper is assessing statistical significance of the resulting predictive relationships. Failure to account for dependence between models, variables, locations, and seasons is shown to yield misleading results. A new technique for testing the field significance of data-mined correlations which avoids these problems is presented. Using this new approach, all 41,741 relationships we tested were found to be explainable by chance.

The authors begin by noting several issues with the standard approach for decomposing ECS into a sum of forcing and feedback terms. This leads to a derivation of an alternative method based on linearizing the effect of the net feedback. Consistent with previous studies, the new method identifies shortwave cloud feedback as the dominant source of intermodel spread in ECS. This new approach also reveals that covariances between cloud feedback and forcing, between lapse rate and longwave cloud feedbacks, and between albedo and shortwave cloud feedbacks play an important and previously underappreciated role in determining model differences in ECS. Defining feedbacks based on fixed relative rather than specific humidity (as suggested by Held and Shell) reduces the covariances between processes and leads to more straightforward inte...},

In both AGCMs, for the historical period as a whole, the effective climate sensitivity is ∼2 K ($\alpha$≃1.7 Wm−2 K−1), and $\alpha$ shows substantial decadal variation caused by the patterns of SST change. Both models agree with the AGCMs of the latest Coupled Model Intercomparison Project in showing a considerably smaller effective climate sensitivity of ∼1.5 K ($\alpha$ = 2.3 ± 0.7 Wm−2 K−1), given the time-dependent changes in sea-surface conditions observed during 1979–2008, than the corresponding coupled atmosphere–ocean general circulation models (AOGCMs) give under constant quadrupled CO2 concentration.

If the compensation between feedbacks is removed, the 95{\%} confidence interval for climate sensitivity expands to 1.9°–8.0°C. Neither of the quoted 95{\%} intervals adequately reflects the understanding of climate sensitivity, but their differences illustrate that model interdependencies must be understood before model spread can be correctly interpreted.

Evidence is accumulating that the same constraint may apply on the much larger scale of the Earth-atmosphere system. The concept is accepted as the basis of a purely thermodynamic model of the mean annual global climate. The model allows a priori calculation of the broad-scale geographic distributions of cloud, surface temperature, horizontal energy fluxes in the ocean and in the atmosphere, net radiant energy inputs, etc. The agreement with observation strongly supports the basic concept.

abstract = {The interplay between clouds and aerosols and their contribution to the radiation budget is one of the largest uncertainties of climate change. Most work to date has separated cloudy and cloud-free areas in order to evaluate the individual radiative forcing of aerosols, clouds, and aerosol effects on clouds. Here we examine the size distribution and the optical properties of small, sparse cumulus clouds and the associated optical properties of what is considered a cloud-free atmosphere within the cloud field. We show that any separation between clouds and cloud free atmosphere will incur errors in the calculated radiative forcing. The nature of small cumulus cloud size distributions suggests that at any resolution, a significant fraction of the clouds are missed, and their optical properties are relegated to the apparent cloud-free optical properties. At the same time, the cloudy portion incorporates significant contribution from non-cloudy pixels. We show that the largest contribution to the total cloud reflectance comes from the smallest clouds and that the spatial resolution changes the apparent energy flux of a broken cloudy scene. When changing the resolution from 30 m to 1 km (Landsat to MODIS) the average "cloud-free" reflectance at 1.65 um increases from 0.0095 to 0.0115 ({\textgreater}20{\%}), the cloud reflectance decreases from 0.13 to 0.066 (50{\%}), and the cloud coverage doubles, resulting in an important impact on climate forcing estimations.

Despite decades of research, it has proved frustratingly difficult to establish climatically meaningful relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation. As a result, the climatic effect of the aerosol remains controversial. We propose that the difficulty in untangling relationships among the aerosol, clouds and precipitation reflects the inadequacy of existing tools and methodologies and a failure to account for processes that buffer cloud and precipitation responses to aerosol perturbations.},

The major simplification made is to “relax”the state toward equilibrium each time the parameterization is invoked, rather than requiring that the final state be balanced, as in the original Arakawa-Schubert implementation. This relaxed Arakawa-Schubert (RAS) scheme is evaluated in off-line tests using the Global Atmospheric Research Programme (GARP) Atlantic Tropical Experiment (GATE) Phase III data. The results show that RAS is equivalent to the standard implementation of Arakawa-Schubert but is more economical and simpler to code. RAS also avoids the ill-posed problem that occurs in Arakawa-Schubert as a result of having to solve for a balanced state.},

abstract = {Cloud cover and relative humidity in the Tropics are strongly influenced by organized atmospheric convection, which occurs across a range of spatial and temporal scales. One mode of organization that is found in idealized numerical modelling simulations is self-aggregation, a spontaneous transition from randomly distributed convection to organized convection despite homogeneous boundary conditions. We explore the influence of domain geometry on the mechanisms, growth rates and length-scales of self-aggregation of tropical convection. We simulate radiative-convective equilibrium with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM), in a non-rotating, highly elongated three-dimensional (3D) channel domain of length {\textgreater}104 km, with interactive radiation and surface fluxes and fixed sea-surface temperature varying from 280-310 K. Convection self-aggregates into multiple moist and dry bands across this full range of temperatures. As convection aggregates, we find a decrease in upper tropospheric cloud fraction but an increase in lower tropospheric cloud fraction; this sensitivity of clouds to aggregation agrees with observations in the upper troposphere but not in the lower troposphere. An advantage of the channel geometry is that a separation distance between convectively active regions can be defined; we present a theory for this distance based on boundary layer. We find that surface fluxes and radiative heating act as positive feedback mechanisms, favouring self-aggregation, but advection of moist static energy acts as a negative feedback, opposing self-aggregation, for nearly all temperatures and times. Early in the process of self-aggregation, surface fluxes are a positive feedback at all temperatures, shortwave radiation is a strong positive feedback at low surface temperatures but weakens at higher temperatures and longwave radiation is a negative feedback at low temperatures but becomes a positive feedback for temperatures greater than 295-300 K. Clouds contribute strongly to the radiative feedback, especially at low temperatures.},

We argue that this result is indeed credible, as are the supplementary predictions that the land will on average warm by around 50{\%} more than the oceans, high latitudes more than the tropics, and that the hydrological cycle will generally intensify. Beyond these and similar broad statements, however, we presently find little evidence of trustworthy predictions at fine spatial scale and annual to decadal timescale from climate models.

This study presents an explanation of this phenomenon in the context of the statistically indistinguishable paradigm and also provides a quantitative analysis of the main factors that control how likely the mean is to outperform the models in the ensemble, both individually and collectively. The analyses lend further support to the usage of the paradigm of a statistically indistinguishable ensemble and indicate that the current ensemble size is too small to adequately sample the space from which the models are drawn.},

abstract = {The chemical composition of the earths atmosphere far from equilibrium is unique in the solar system and has been attributed to the presence of widespread life. Here I show that this perspective can be quantified using non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Generating disequilibrium in a thermodynamic variable requires the extraction of power from another thermodynamic gradient, and the second law of thermodynamics imposes fundamental limits on how much power can be extracted. When applied to complex earth system processes, where several irreversible processes compete to deplete the same gradients, it is easily shown that the maximum thermodynamic efficiency is much less than the classic Carnot limit, so that the ability of the earth system to generate power and disequilibrium is limited. This approach is used to quantify how much free energy is generated by various earth system processes to generate chemical disequilibrium. It is shown that surface life generates orders of magnitude more chemical free energy than any abiotic surface process, therefore being the primary driving force for shaping the geochemical environment at the planetary scale. To apply this perspective to the possible future of the planet, we first note that the free energy consumption by human activity is a considerable term in the free energy budget of the planet, and that global changes are closely related to this consumption of free energy. Since human activity and demands for free energy is going to increase in the future, the central question is how human free energy demands can increase sustainably without negatively impacting the ability of the earth system to generate free energy. I illustrate the implications of this thermodynamic perspective by discussing the forms of renewable energy and planetary engineering that would enhance overall free energy generation and thereby "empower" the future of the planet.},

Here, we test this so-called “zero-buoyancy" theory for CAPE by modulating the saturation deficit of cloud-resolving simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium in two ways: changing the sea surface temperature (SST), and changing the environmental relative humidity (RH). For earthlike and warmer SSTs, undilute parcel buoyancy in the lower troposphere is insensitive to increasing SST because of a countervailing CC-scaling that balances the increase in the saturation deficit; however, buoyancy increases dramatically with SST in the upper troposphere. Conversely, in the RH experiment, undilute buoyancy throughout the troposphere increases monotonically with decreasing RH. We show that the zero-buoyancy theory successfully predicts these contrasting behaviors, building confidence that it describes the fundamental physics of CAPE and its response to warming.},

Analytical expressions are derived for the damping time scale and descent speed of wind profiles as caused by unorganized convection. Unlike Rayleigh drag, which has a constant damping time scale and zero descent speed, the theory predicts a damping time scale and a descent speed that both depend on the vertical wavelength of the wind profile. These results predict that short wavelengths damp faster and descend faster than long wavelengths, and these predictions are confirmed using large-eddy simulations. Both theory and simulations predict that the convective damping of large-scale circulations occurs on a time scale of O(1–10) days for vertical wavelengths in the range of 2–10 km.},

Such regions are proposed as an advantageous prototype for rising air parcels due to their prolonged identity as evident in laboratory flows. Buoyancy and other forces are generally less than 0.02 m s−2 (0.7 K). In particular, resolved mixing between thermals and their environment fails to produce the drag normally anticipated, often producing even a slight upward force, indicating that parcel models should allow for significantly different dilution rates for momentum than for material properties.

abstract = {Entrainment and detrainment processes have been recognised for a long time as key processes for cumulus convection and have recently witnessed a regrowth of interest mainly due to the capability of large-eddy simulations (LES) to diagnose these processes in more detail. This article has a twofold purpose. Firstly, it provides a historical overview of the past research on these mixing processes, and secondly, it highlights more recent important developments. These include both fundamental process studies using LES aiming to improve our understanding of the mixing process, but also more practical studies targeted toward an improved parametrised representation of entrainment and detrainment in large-scale models. A highlight of the fundamental studies resolves a long-lasting controversy by showing that lateral entrainment is the dominant mixing mechanism in comparison with the cloud-top entrainment in shallow cumulus convection. The more practical studies provide a wide variety of new parametrisations with sometimes conflicting approaches to the way in which the effect of the free tropospheric humidity on the lateral mixing is taken into account. An important new insight that will be highlighted is that, despite the focus in the literature on entrainment, it appears that it is rather the detrainment process that determines the vertical structure of the convection in general and the mass flux especially. Finally, in order to speed up progress and stimulate convergence in future parametrisations, stronger and more systematic use of LES is advocated. Copyright (c) 2012 Royal Meteorological Society},

abstract = {Abstract It is held that entrainment is a necessary dynamic consequence of the vertical stretching of an accelerated convective column. On this basis, equations are developed for the rate of entrainment, the vertical divergence and the lapse rate, for both unsaturated air and cloud air. It is assumed that a steady state exists, the cross section of the rising column is invariant with height, the entrained air is uniformly mixed with the rising air and the environment is at rest. The equations are integrated numerically over height in a number of selected cases. In unsaturated air, entrainment results in a lapse rate which is always greater than the dry adiabatic; if the environmental lapse-rate is superadiabatic, the lapse rate of the rising air is intermediate between the lapse rate of the environment and the dry adiabatic lapse-rate. In a cloud, entrainment results in a lapse rate intermediate between the environmental lapse-rate and the moist adiabatic lapse-rate. The lapse rate of the rising air increases as the relative humidity of the environment decreases. As a result of entrainment, the cloud liquid-water content increases with height at a significantly slower rate than would result from a simple lifting process. A decrease in the humidity of the environment reduces the rate of increase of liquid water with height, but it does not appear possible to ?dry out? the cloud even in a dry environment. The horizontal velocity-convergence is found to be of the order of 10?3 sec?1, and the computed vertical velocities in the cloud are in general agreement with those observed by the Thunderstorm Project. It is pointed out that the entrained air may be added through an ordered inflow, by turbulent exchange or by a combination of the two. It is assumed here that an ordered inflow occurs.},

The atmosphere in thermal equilibrium has an isothermal lower stratosphere and an inversion in the upper stratosphere which are features observed in middle latitudes. The role of various gaseous absorbers (i.e., water vapor, carbon dioxide, and ozone), as well as the role of the clouds, is investigated by computing thermal equilibrium with and without one or two of these elements.

We analyze the HadCRUT4 observational data set which has the most comprehensive set of adjustments available to date for systematic biases in sea surface temperatures and the CMIP5 ensemble of coupled models which represents the most sophisticated multi-model climate modeling exercise yet carried out. Simulations that incorporate both anthropogenic and natural factors span changes in observed temperatures between 1860 and 2010, while simulations of natural factors do not warm as much as observed. As a result of sampling a much wider range of structural modeling uncertainty, we find a wider spread of historic temperature changes in CMIP5 than was simulated by the previous multi-model ensemble, CMIP3. However, calculations of attributable temperature trends based on optimal detection support previous conclusions that human-induced greenhouse gases dominate observed global warming since the mid-20th century. With a much wider exploration of model uncertainty than previously carried out, we find that individually the models give a wide range of possible counteracting cooling from the direct and indirect effects of aerosols and other non-greenhouse gas anthropogenic forcings. Analyzing the multi-model mean over 1951-2010 (focusing on the most robust result), we estimate a range of possible contributions to the observed warming of approximately 0.6 K from greenhouse gases of between 0.6 and 1.2 K, balanced by a counteracting cooling from other anthropogenic forcings of between 0 and -0.5 K.

The main application is toward anthropogenic climate change, considered as the response of D to a small-amplitude imposed forcing f. The primary features of this perspective can be summarized as follows. First, the response to f will be manifest primarily in terms of changes to the residence frequency associated with the quasi-stationary regimes. Second, the geographical structures of these regimes will be relatively insensitive to f. Third, the large-scale signal will be most strongly influenced by f in rather localized regions of space and time. In this perspective, the signal arising from f will be strongly dependent of D's natural variability. A theoretical framework for the perspective is developed based on a singular vector decomposition of D's tangent propagator. Evidence for the dyamical perspective ...},

abstract = {We report an estimate of the Earth's average land surface temperature for the period 1753 to 2011. To address issues of potential station selection bias, we used a larger sampling of stations than had prior studies. For the period post 1880, our estimate is similar to those previously reported by other groups, although we report smaller uncertainties. The land temperature rise from the 1950s decade to the 2000s decade is 0.90 ± 0.05°C (95{\%} confidence). Both maximum and minimum daily temperatures have increased during the last century. Diurnal variations decreased from 1900 to 1987, and then increased; this increase is significant but not understood. The period of 1753 to 1850 is marked by sudden drops in land surface temperature that are coincident with known volcanism; the response function is approximately 1.5 ± 0.5°C per 100 Tg of atmospheric sulfate. This volcanism, combined with a simple proxy for anthropogenic effects (logarithm of the CO2 concentration), reproduces much of the variation in the land surface temperature record; the fit is not improved by the addition of a solar forcing term. Thus, for this very simple model, solar forcing does not appear to contribute to the observed global warming of the past 250 years; the entire change can be modeled by a sum of volcanism and a single anthropogenic proxy. The residual variations include interannual and multi-decadal variability very similar to that of the Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation (AMO)},

The key assumptions of the model are gray radiation, with water vapor and other constituents having no effect on radiative transfer, and mixed layer aquaplanet boundary conditions, implying that the atmospheric meridional energy transport balances the net radiation at the top of the atmosphere. These simplifications allow the authors to isolate the effect of moisture on energy transports by baroclinic eddies in a relatively simple setting. The authors investigate the partition of moist static energy transport in the model into dry static energy and latent energy transports as water vapor concentrations are increased, by varying a constant in the Clausius–Clapeyron relation. The increase in the poleward moisture flux is rather precisely compensated by a reduction in the dry static energy flux. These results are interpreted with diffusive energy balance models (EBMs). The simplest of these is an analytic model that has the property of exact invariance of total energy flux as the moisture content is changed, but the assumptions underlying this model are not accurately satisfied by the GCM. A more complex EBM that includes expressions for the diffusivity, length scale, velocity scale, and latitude of maximum baroclinic eddy activity provides a better fit to the GCM's behavior.},

The large domain allows a number of tropical storms to exist simultaneously. Once equilibrium is attained, storms often persist for hundreds of days. The number of storms decreases as sea surface temperatures increase, while the average intensity increases. As the background rotation is decreased, the number of storms also decreases.

abstract = {An uncertain representation of convective clouds has emerged as one of the key barriers to our understanding of climate sensitivity. The large gap in resolved spatial scales between General Circulation Models (GCMs) and high resolution models has made a systematic study of convective clouds across model configurations difficult. It is shown here that the simulated atmosphere of a GCM in Radiative Convective Equilibrium (RCE) is sufficiently similar across a range of domain sizes to justify the use of RCE to study both a GCM and a high resolution model on the same domain with the goal of improved constraints on the parameterized clouds. Simulations of RCE with parameterized convection have been analyzed on domains with areas spanning more than two orders of magnitude (0.80 - 204 × 106 km2), all having the same grid spacing of 13km. The simulated climates on different domains are qualitatively similar in their degree of convective organization, the precipitation rates, and the vertical structure of the clouds and water vapor, with the similarity increasing as the domain size increases. Sea surface temperature perturbation experiments are used to estimate the climate feedback parameter for the differently configured experiments, and the cloud radiative effect is computed to examine the role which clouds play in the response. Despite the similar climate states between the domains the feedback parameter varies by more than a factor of two; the hydrological sensitivity parameter is better behaved, varying by a factor of 1.4. The sensitivity of the climate feedback parameter to domain size is related foremost to a non-systematic response of low-level clouds as well as an increasingly negative longwave feedback on larger domains.

Radiative feedbacks on MSE natural variability and perturbation growth are found to be positive, broadly similar across scales, and comparable to limited-area CRMs, capable of e-folding a column MSE perturbation in 6–14 days. Surface fluxes are highest in synoptic-scale dry intrusions, inhibiting aggregation by damping tropical MSE perturbations. Sub-4-day MSE variations are due mainly to advection.

abstract = {We investigate the sensitivity of cloud feedbacks to the use of convective parametrizations by repeating the CMIP5/CFMIP-2 AMIP/AMIP + 4K uniform sea surface temperature perturbation experiments with 10 climate models which have had their convective parametrizations turned off. Previous studies have suggested that differences between parametrized convection schemes are a leading source of inter-model spread in cloud feedbacks. We find however that 'ConvOff' models with convection switched off have a similar overall range of cloud feedbacks compared with the standard configurations. Furthermore, applying a simple bias correction method to allow for differences in present-day global cloud radiative effects substantially reduces the differences between the cloud feedbacks with and without parametrized convection in the individual models. We conclude that, while parametrized convection influences the strength of the cloud feedbacks substantially in some models, other processes must also contribute substantially to the overall inter-model spread. The positive shortwave cloud feedbacks seen in the models in subtropical regimes associated with shallow clouds are still present in the ConvOff experiments. Inter-model spread in shortwave cloud feedback increases slightly in regimes associated with trade cumulus in the ConvOff experiments but is quite similar in the most stable subtropical regimes associated with stratocumulus clouds. Inter-model spread in longwave cloud feedbacks in strongly precipitating regions of the tropics is substantially reduced in the ConvOff experiments however, indicating a considerable local contribution from differences in the details of convective parametrizations. In both standard and ConvOff experiments, models with less mid-level cloud and less moist static energy near the top of the boundary layer tend to have more positive tropical cloud feedbacks. The role of non-convective processes in contributing to inter-model spread in cloud feedback is discussed.},

abstract = {A radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) configuration of a comprehensive atmospheric general circulation model, ECHAM6, is coupled to a mixed-layer ocean for the purpose of advancing understanding of climate and climate change. This configuration differs from a standard configuration only through the removal of land-surface processes, spatial gradients in solar insolation, and the effects of rotation. Nonetheless, the model produces a climate that resembles the tropical climate in a control simulation of Earth's atmosphere. In the RCE configuration, regional inhomogeneities in surface temperature develop. These inhomogeneities are transient in time but sufficiently long-lived to establish large-scale overturning circulations with a distribution similar to the preindustrial tropics in the standard configuration. The vertical structure of the atmosphere, including profiles of clouds and condensate conditioned on the strength of overturning, also resembles those produced by a control simulation of Earth's tropical atmosphere. The equilibrium climate sensitivity of the RCE atmosphere can explain 50{\%} of the global climate sensitivity of a realistic configuration of ECHAM6. Part of the difference is attributed to the lack of polar amplification in RCE. The remainder appears to be related to a less positive cloud shortwave feedback, which results from an increase in low cloudiness with increasing surface temperatures in the RCE configuration. The RCE configuration shows an increase of climate sensitivity in a warmer climate. The increase in climate sensitivity scales with the degree to which the upper-troposphere temperature departs from a moist adiabat.},

Forcings and feedbacks that impact the warming response are estimated for both Arctic and global regions based on standard model diagnostics. Fitting a zero-dimensional energy balance model to each region, an expression is derived that gives the Arctic amplification as a function of these forcings and feedbacks. Contributing to Arctic amplification are the Arctic-global differences in surface albedo feedback (SAF), longwave feedback and the net top-of-atmosphere flux forcing (the sum of the surface flux and the atmospheric heat transport convergence). The doubled CO2 forcing and non-SAF shortwave feedback oppose Arctic amplification. SAF is shown to be a contributing, but not a dominating, factor in the simulated Arctic amplification and its intermodel variation.},

abstract = {Neoproterozoic, and possibly Paleoproterozoic, glaciations represent the most extreme climate events in post-Hadean Earth, and may link closely with the evolution of the atmosphere and life. According to the Snowball Earth hypothesis, the entire ocean was covered with ice during these events for a few million years, during which time volcanic CO2 increased enough to cause deglaciation. Geochemical proxy data and model calculations suggest that the maximum CO2 was 0.01–0.1 by volume, but early climate modeling suggested that deglaciation was not possible at CO2 = 0.2. We use results from six different general circulation models (GCMs) to show that clouds could warm a Snowball enough to reduce the CO2 required for deglaciation by a factor of 10–100. Although more work is required to rigorously validate cloud schemes in Snowball-like conditions, our results suggest that Snowball deglaciation is consistent with observations.},

This is especially true as the AGCM community advances toward high horizontal resolutions (i.e., grid spacing less than 50 km), which will require interpreting and improving the performance of many model components. A simplified global radiative–convective equilibrium (RCE) configuration is proposed to explore the implication of horizontal resolution on equilibrium climate. RCE is the statistical equilibrium in which the radiative cooling of the atmosphere is balanced by heating due to convection.In this work, the Community Atmosphere Model, version 5 (CAM5), is configured in RCE to better understand tropical climate and extremes.

abstract = {Previous work has shown that convection will self-organize in cloud-system-resolving model simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium, and it has been suggested that the convective envelope of the Madden-Julian oscillation (MJO) may be organized by similar processes on a much larger scale. Here we present support for that hypothesis based on simulations with SP-CAM with globally uniform SST. Without rotation, convection self-organizes into large (∼4000 km) clusters surrounded by dry regions, while with Earth-like rotation the model produces a robust MJO. The nonrotating aggregation and MJO are found to have similar budgets of moist static energy, both being supported by diabatic feedbacks, particularly cloud-longwave interaction. Mechanism denial experiments show that longwave heating anomalies associated with high clouds are essential to the nonrotating aggregation, and amplify the MJO. Simulations using the conventional CAM show a weaker MJO and a much weaker tendency for nonrotating aggregation, and both MJO activity and aggregation intensity are found to increase with the entrainment rate in the deep convection parameterization.},

abstract = {Rotating radiative–convective equilibrium is studied by extracting the column physics of a mesoscale-resolution global atmospheric model that simulates realistic hurricane frequency statistics and then coupling it to rotating hydrostatic dynamics in doubly periodic domains. The parameter study helps in understanding the tropical cyclones simulated in the global model and also provides a reference point for analogous studies with cloud-resolving models. The authors first examine the sensitivity of the equilibrium achieved in a large square domain (2 × 104 km on a side) to sea surface temperature, ambient rotation rate, and surface drag coefficient. In such a large domain, multiple tropical cyclones exist simultaneously. The size and intensity of these tropical cyclones are investigated. The variation of rotating radiative–convective equilibrium with domain size is also studied. As domain size increases, the equilibrium evolves through four regimes: a single tropical depression, an intermittent tropical cyclone with widely varying intensity, a single sustained storm, and finally multiple storms. As SST increases or ambient rotation rate f decreases, the sustained storm regime shifts toward larger domain size. The storm's natural extent in large domains can be understood from this regime behavior. The radius of maximum surface wind, although only marginally resolved, increases with SST and increases with f for small f when the domain is large enough. These parameter dependencies can be modified or even reversed if the domain is smaller than the storm's natural extent.},

abstract = {The past decade has seen substantial advances in understanding Arctic amplification - that trends and variability in surface air temperature tend to be larger in the Arctic region than for the Northern Hemisphere or globe as a whole. We provide a synthesis of research on Arctic amplification, starting with a historical context and then addressing recent insights into processes and key impacts, based on analysis of the instrumental record, modeling studies, and paleoclimate reconstructions. Arctic amplification is now recognized as an inherent characteristic of the global climate system, with multiple intertwined causes operating on a spectrum of spatial and temporal scales. These include, but are not limited to, changes in sea ice extent that impact heat fluxes between the ocean and the atmosphere, atmospheric and oceanic heat transports, cloud cover and water vapor that alter the longwave radiation flux to the surface, soot on snow and heightened black carbon aerosol concentrations. Strong warming over the Arctic Ocean during the past decade in autumn and winter, clearly associated with reduced sea ice extent, is but the most recent manifestation of the phenomenon. Indeed, periods of Arctic amplification are evident from analysis of both warm and cool periods over at least the past three million years. Arctic amplification being observed today is expected to become stronger in coming decades, invoking changes in atmospheric circulation, vegetation and the carbon cycle, with impacts both within and beyond the Arctic. ?? 2011.},

abstract = {The sensitivity of an idealized climate system model consisting of an atmospheric GCM coupled to an oceanic upper mixed layer on an aquaplanet is analyzed. There is no seasonal cycle and the solar radiation is taken to be symmetric about the equator. The system is integrated with the observed CO, (330 ppm) until it reaches a quasi-equilibrium climate. To study the sensitivity we double the CO2 and again integrate until the system reaches a new equilibrium climate. To simplify the linear analysis we assume that the atmosphere is always in quasi-equilibrium (typical atmospheric adjustment times being much shorter than that of the oceanic upper mixed layer). We introduce a linear surface energy budget sensitivity (or response) operator consisting of a Jacobian matrix of the surface budget with respect to the surface temperature. The operator is used to construct a linear estimate of the surface temperature change that results from the CO2 doubling. It is found that the temperature response obtained from the linear estimate compares well with the results of the full 3D run. The shape of the response looks very similar to that of the least stable mode of the linear surface budget sensitivity operator. The importance of different components of the initial forcing at the surface is discussed. The role of the individual components in determining the final equilibrium climate is also studied.},

abstract = {Polar amplification of surface warming has previously been displayed by one of the authors in a simplified climate system model with no ice-albedo feedbacks. A physical mechanism responsible for this pattern is presented and tested in an energy balance model and two different GCMs through a series of fixed-SST and "ghost forcing" experiments. In the first ghost forcing experiment, 4 W/m(2) is added uniformly to the mixed layer heat budget and in the second and third, the same forcing is confined to the tropics and extra-tropics, respectively. The result of the uniform forcing is a polar amplified response much like that resulting from a doubling Of CO2. Due to an observed linearity this response can be interpreted as the sum of the essentially uniform response to the tropical-only forcing and a more localized response to the extra-tropical-only forcing. The flat response to the tropical forcing comes about due to increased meridional heat transports leading to a warming and moistening of the high-latitude atmosphere. This produces a longwave forcing on the high-latitude surface budget which also has been observed by other investigators. Moreover, the tropical surface budget is found to be more sensitive to SST changes than the extra-tropical surface budget. This strengthens the tendency for the above mechanism to produce polar amplification, since the tropics need to warm less to counter an imposed forcing.},

abstract = {An aquaplanet atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) coupled to a mixed layer ocean is analyzed in terms of its polar amplified surface temperature response to a 2xCO(2)-like steady forcing and in terms of the phase space trajectory of the relaxation of a free perturbation to equilibrium. In earlier studies concerned with linear stability analysis of the same system we have shown that the least stable mode of the linearized surface budget operator has a polar amplified shape. We demonstrate that this shape of the least stable mode is responsible for the polar amplified shape of the response to a uniform forcing and for the manner in which the system relaxes back to equilibrium. Based on GCM and simple energy balance model results it is argued that the decay time-scale of this mode is determined by the sensitivity of the net top-of-atmosphere radiation to surface temperature while its shape (and thus the degree of polar amplification in a climate change experiment) is determined by the sensitivity of poleward heat transports to low- and high-latitude temperatures by the faster time-scale atmospheric dynamics. This implies that the underlying mechanisms for the polar amplification may be obscured when studying feedbacks during the slow evolution of climate change or considering only the new equilibrium state after introduction of a steady forcing.},

abstract = {The response of North Atlantic and European extratropical cyclones to climate change is investigated in the climate models participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5). In contrast to previous multimodel studies, a feature-tracking algorithm is here applied to separately quantify the responses in the number, the wind intensity, and the precipitation intensity of extratropical cyclones. Moreover, a statistical framework is employed to formally assess the uncertainties in the multimodel projections. Under the midrange representative concentration pathway (RCP4.5) emission scenario, the December–February (DJF) response is characterized by a tripolar pattern over Europe, with an increase in the number of cyclones in central Europe and a decreased number in the Norwegian and Mediterranean Seas. The June–August (JJA) response is characterized by a reduction in the number of North Atlantic cyclones along the southern flank of the storm track. The total number of cyclones decreases in both DJF (−4{\%}) and JJA (−2{\%}). Classifying cyclones according to their intensity indicates a slight basinwide reduction in the number of cyclones associated with strong winds, but an increase in those associated with strong precipitation. However, in DJF, a slight increase in the number and intensity of cyclones associated with strong wind speeds is found over the United Kingdom and central Europe. The results are confirmed under the high-emission RCP8.5 scenario, where the signals tend to be larger. The sources of uncertainty in these projections are discussed.},

Cyclones are identified as maxima in T42 vorticity at 850 hPa and their propagation is tracked using an objective feature-tracking algorithm. By comparing the historical CMIP5 simulations (1976–2005) and the ECMWF Interim Re-Analysis (ERA-Interim; 1979–2008), the authors find that systematic biases affect the number and intensity of North Atlantic cyclones in CMIP5 models. In DJF, the North Atlantic storm track tends to be either too zonal or displaced southward, thus leading to too few and weak cyclones over the Norwegian Sea and too many cyclones in central Europe. In JJA, the position of the North Atlantic storm track is generally well captured but some CMIP5 models underestimate the total number of cyclones. The dynamical intensity of cyclone...},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

The new model is designed to perform "cloud resolving simulations" by directly calculating deep convection and meso-scale circulations, which play key roles not only in the tropical circulations but in the global circulations of the atmosphere. Since cores of deep convection have a few km in horizontal size, they have not directly been resolved by existing atmospheric general circulation models (AGCMs). In order to drastically enhance horizontal resolution, a new framework of a global atmospheric model is required; we adopted nonhydrostatic governing equations and icosahedral grids to the new model, and call it Nonhydrostatic ICosahedral Atmospheric Model (NICAM). In this article, we review governing equations and numerical techniques employed, and present the results from the unique 3.5-km mesh global experiments-with O(109) computational nodes-using realistic topography and land/ocean surface thermal forcing. The results show realistic behaviors of multi-scale convective systems in the tropics, which have not been captured by AGCMs. We also argue future perspective of the roles of the new model in the next generation atmospheric sciences. ?? 2007 Elsevier Inc.

abstract = {With many operational centres moving towards order 1km gridlength models for routine weather forecasting, this paper presents a systematic investigation of the properties of high resolution versions of the Met Office Unified model for short range forecasting of convective rainfall events. We describe a suite of configurations of the Met Office Unified model running with gridlengths of 12km, 4km and 1km and analyse results from these models for a number of convective cases from the summers of 2003, 2004 and 2005. The analysis includes subjective evaluation of the rainfall fields and comparisons of rainfall amounts, initiation, cell statistics and a scale selective verification technique. It is shown that the 4km and 1km gridlength models often give more realistic looking precipitation fields because convection is represented explicitly rather than parameterised. However the 4km model representation suffers from large convective cells and delayed initiation as a result of the gridlength being too long to correctly reproduce the convection explicitly. These problems are not as evident in the 1km model although it does suffer from too numerous small cells in some situations. Both the 4km and 1km models suffer from poor representation at the start of the forecast in the period when the high resolution detail is spinning up from the lower resolution (12km) starting data used. A scale selective precipitation verification technique implies that for later times in the forecasts (after the spin up period) the 1km model performs better than the 12km and 4km models for lower rainfall thresholds. For higher thresholds the 4km model scores almost as well as the 1km and both do better than the 12km.},

These configurations used the same physical parameterizations and the same input dataset for the initial and boundary conditions, differing primarily in their spatial resolution.

In general, extreme precipitation amounts are larger in high resolution than in lower resolution configurations. In many but not all locations and/or seasons, extreme daily precipitation rates in the high-resolution configuration are higher and more realistic. The high-resolution configuration produces tropical cyclones up to category 5 on the Saffir-Simpson scale and a comparison to observations reveals both realistic and unrealistic model behavior.

abstract = {AbstractData from global high-resolution, nonhydrostatic simulations, covering a 1-yr period and with horizontal grid sizes of 7 and 14 km, were analyzed to evaluate the response of high cloud to global warming. The results indicate that, in a warmer atmosphere, high-cloud cover increases robustly and associated longwave (LW) cloud radiative forcing (CRF) increases on average. To develop a better understanding of high-cloud responses to climate change, the geographical distribution of high-cloud size obtained from the model was analyzed and compared with observations. In warmer atmospheres, the contribution per cloud to CRF decreases for both the LW and shortwave (SW) components. However, because of significant increases in the numbers of high clouds in almost all cloud size categories, the magnitude of both LW and SW CRF increases in the simulations. In particular, the contribution from an increase in the number of smaller clouds has more effect on the CRF change. It was also found that the ice and liquid water paths decrease in smaller clouds and that particularly the former contributes to reduced LW CRF per high cloud.},

abstract = {A cumulus parameterization based on mass fluxes, convective-scale vertical velocities, and mesoscale effects has been incorporated in an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM). Most contemporary cumulus parameterizations are based on convective mass fluxes. This parameterization augments mass fluxes with convective-scale vertical velocities as a means of providing a method for incorporating cumulus microphysics using vertical velocities at physically appropriate (subgrid) scales. Convective-scale microphysics provides a key source of material for mesoscale circulations associated with deep convection, along with mesoscale in situ microphysical processes. The latter depend on simple, parameterized mesoscale dynamics. Consistent treatment of convection, microphysics, and radiation is crucial for modeling global-scale interactions involving clouds and radiation.Thermodynamic and hydrological aspects of this parameterization in integrations of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory SKYHI GCM are analyzed. Mass fluxes, phase changes, and heat and moisture transport by the mesoscale components of convective systems are found to be large relative to those of convective (deep tower) components, in agreement with field studies. Partitioning between the convective and mesoscale components varies regionally with large-scale flow characteristics and agrees well with observations from the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite.The effects of the mesoscale components of convective systems include stronger Hadley and Walker circulations, warmer upper-tropospheric Tropics, and moister Tropics. The mass fluxes for convective systems including mesoscale components differ appreciably in both magnitude and structure from those for convective systems consisting of cells only. When mesoscale components exist, detrainment is concentrated in the midtroposphere instead of the upper troposphere, and the magnitudes of mass fluxes are smaller. The parameterization including mesoscale components is consistent with satellite observations of the size distribution of convective systems, while the parameterization with convective cells only is not.The parameterization of convective vertical velocities is an important control on the intensity of the mesoscale stratiform circulations associated with deep convection. The mesoscale components are less intense than in TRMM observations if spatially and temporally invariant convective vertical velocities are used instead of parameterized, variable velocities.},

abstract = {Abstract The configuration and performance of a new global atmosphere and land model for climate research developed at the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) are presented. The atmosphere model, known as AM2, includes a new gridpoint dynamical core, a prognostic cloud scheme, and a multispecies aerosol climatology, as well as components from previous models used at GFDL. The land model, known as LM2, includes soil sensible and latent heat storage, groundwater storage, and stomatal resistance. The performance of the coupled model AM2–LM2 is evaluated with a series of prescribed sea surface temperature (SST) simulations. Particular focus is given to the model's climatology and the characteristics of interannual variability related to E1 Ni{\~{n}}o– Southern Oscillation (ENSO). One AM2–LM2 integration was performed according to the prescriptions of the second Atmospheric Model Intercomparison Project (AMIP II) and data were submitted to the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison (PCMDI)....},

Simple heat sinks are prescribed in shallow aquaplanet ocean mixed layers underlying atmospheric general circulation models independently and combined with CO2 forcing. Sinks are localized to either tropical or high latitudes, representing distinct modes of OHU found in coupled simulations. Tropical OHU produces modest cooling at all latitudes, offsetting only a fraction of CO2 warming. Highlatitude OHU produces three times more global mean cooling in a strongly polar-amplified pattern. Global sensitivities in each scenario are set primarily by large differences in local shortwave cloud feedbacks, robust across models. Differences in atmospheric energy transport set the pattern of temperature change. Results imply that global and regional warming rates depend sensitively on regional ocean processes setting the OHU pattern, and that equilibrium climate sensitivity cannot be reliably estimated from transient observations.},

Output from the Clouds On–Off Klimate Intercomparison Experiment (COOKIE) is used to examine the impact of cloud radiative effects on circulation and climate. In aquaplanet simulations with a fixed SST pattern, the cloud radiative effect leads to an equatorward contraction of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and a reduction of the double ITCZ problem. It is shown that the cloud radiative heating in the upper troposphere increases the temperature, weakens CAPE, and inhibits the onset of convection until it is closer to the equator, where SSTs are higher. Precipitation peaks at higher values in a narrower band when the cloud radiative effects are active, compared to when they are inactive, owing to the enhancement in moisture convergence. Additionally, cloud–radiation interactions strengthen the mean meridional circulation and consequently enhance the moisture convergence. Although the mean tropica...},

Local feedback analysis succeeds at accounting for the EBM-simulated temperature change given the changes in the radiative forcing, atmospheric energy transport, and radiative feedbacks. However, the inferences about the effect of individual components of the TOA energy balance on regional temperature changes do not account for EBM simulations in which individual components are prescribed or “locked”. As changes in one component of the TOA energy balance affect others, unambiguous attribution statements relating changes in regional temperature or its intermodel spread to individual terms in the TOA energy balance cannot be made.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

We perform simulations of three-dimensional radiative-convective equilibrium with the System for Atmospheric Modeling (SAM) cloud-system-resolving model, with interactive surface temperature, where a highly idealized, low heat capacity circular island is embedded in a slab-ocean domain. The calculated precipitation rate over the island can be more than double the domain average value, with island rainfall occurring primarily in an intense, regular thunderstorm system that forms in the afternoon to early evening each day. Island size affects the magnitude of simulated island rainfall enhancement, the intensity of the convection, and the timing of the rainfall maximum relative to solar noon. A combination of dynamic and thermodynamic mechanisms leads to a monotonic enhancement of domain-averaged tropospheric temperature with increasing fraction of island surface, which may contribute to localization of ascent over the Maritime Continent and its relationship to the Walker Circulation.},

abstract = {Transient climate sensitivity tends to increase on multiple timescales in climate models subject to an abrupt CO 2 increase. The interdependence of radiative and ocean heat uptake processes governing this increase are reviewed. Heat uptake tends to be spatially localized to the subpolar oceans, and this pattern emerges rapidly from an initially uniform distribution. Global climatic impact of heat uptake is studied through the lens of the efficacy concept and a linear systems perspective in which responses to individ-ual climate forcing agents are additive. Heat uptake can be treated as a slowly varying forcing on the atmosphere and surface, whose efficacy is strongly determined by its geographical pattern. An illustrative linear model driven by simple prescribed uptake patterns demonstrates the emer-gence of increasing climate sensitivity as a consequence of the slow decay of high-efficacy subpolar heat uptake. Evidence is reviewed for the key role of shortwave cloud feedbacks in setting the high efficacy of ocean heat uptake and thus in increasing climate sensitivity. A causal phys-ical mechanism is proposed, linking subpolar heat uptake to a global-scale increase in lower-tropospheric stability. It is shown that the rate of increase in estimated inversion strength systematically slows as heat uptake decays. Varia-tions in heat uptake should therefore manifest themselves as differences in low cloud feedbacks.},

Recently, however, similar multidecadal variability was reported in climate models without ocean circulation variability.We analyze the relationship between turbulent heat fluxes and sea surface temperatures (SSTs) over the midlatitude North Atlantic in observations and coupled climate model simulations, both with and without ocean circulation variability. SST anomalies associated with the AMO are positively correlated with heat fluxes on decadal time scales in both observations and models with varying ocean circulation, whereas in models without ocean circulation variability the anomalies are negatively correlated when heat flux anomalies lead. These relationships are captured in a simple stochastic model and rely crucially on low-frequency forcing of SST. The fully coupled models that better capture this signature more effectively reproduce the observed impact of the AMO on European summertime temperatures.},

abstract = {A wide range of hydrological cycles and general circulations was simulated with an idealized general circulation model (GCM) by varying the optical thickness of the longwave absorber. While the idealized GCM does not capture the full complexity of the hydrological cycle, the wide range of climates simulated allows the systematic development and testing of theories of how precipitation and moisture transport change as the climate changes. The simulations show that the character of the response of the hydrological cycle to variations in longwave optical thickness differs in different climate regimes. The global-mean precipitation increases linearly with surface temperature for colder climates, but it asymptotically approaches a maximum at higher surface temperatures. The basic features of the precipi- tation–temperature relation, including the rate of increase in the linear regime, are reproduced in radiative– convective equilibrium simulations. Energy constraints partially account for the precipitation–temperature relation but are not quantitatively accurate. Large-scale condensation is most important in the midlatitude storm tracks, and its behavior is accounted for using a stochastic model of moisture advection and condensation. The precipitation associated with large-scale condensation does not scale with mean specific humidity, partly because the condensation region moves upward and meridionally as the climate warms, and partly because the mean condensation rate depends on isentropic specific humidity gradients, which do not scale with the specific humidity itself. The local water vapor budget relates local precipitation to evaporation and meridional moisture fluxes, whose scaling in the subtropics and extratropics is examined. A delicate balance between opposing changes in evaporation and moisture flux divergence holds in the subtropical dry zones. The extratropical precipi- tation maximum follows the storm track in warm climates but lies equatorward of the storm track in cold climates.},

abstract = {Understanding the role of clouds in climate change remains a considerable challenge. Traditionally, this challenge has been framed in terms of understanding cloud feedback. However, recent work suggests that under increasing levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide, clouds not only amplify or dampen climate change through global feedback processes, but also through rapid (days to weeks) tropospheric temperature and land surface adjustments. In this article, we use the Met Office Hadley Centre climate model HadGSM1 to review these recent developments and assess their impact on radiative forcing and equilibrium climate sensitivity. We estimate that cloud adjustment contributes {\~{}}0.8 K to the 4.4 K equilibrium climate sensitivity of this particular model. We discuss the methods used to evaluate cloud adjustments, highlight the mechanisms and processes involved and identify low level cloudiness as a key cloud type. Looking forward, we discuss the outstanding issues, such as the application to transient forcing scenarios. We suggest that the upcoming CMIP5 multi-model database will allow a comprehensive assessment of the significance of cloud adjustments in fully coupled atmosphere-ocean-general-circulation models for the first time, and that future research should exploit this opportunity to understand cloud adjustments/feedbacks in non-idealised transient climate change scenarios. {\textcopyright} 2011 The Author(s).},

abstract = {Monsoons are generally viewed as planetary-scale sea-breeze circulations, caused by contrasts in the thermal properties between oceans and land surfaces that lead to thermal contrasts upon radiative heating1, 2. But the radiative heating evolves gradually with the seasons, whereas the onset of monsoon precipitation, and the associated circulation changes such as reversal of surface winds, occur rapidly3, 4. Here we use reanalysis data to show that the onset of the Asian monsoon marks a transition between two circulation regimes that are distinct in the degree to which eddy momentum fluxes control the strength of the tropical overturning circulation. Rapid transitions of the circulation between the two regimes can occur as a result of feedbacks between large-scale extratropical eddies and the tropical circulation5. Using simulations with an aquaplanet general circulation model, we demonstrate that rapid, eddy-mediated monsoon transitions occur even in the absence of surface inhomogeneities, provided the planet surface has sufficiently low thermal inertia. On the basis of these results, we propose a view of monsoons in which feedbacks between large-scale extratropical eddies and the tropical circulation are essential for the development of monsoons, whereas surface inhomogeneities such as land-sea contrasts are not.},

abstract = {A dynamical constraint on the extratropical tropopause height and thermal stratification is derived by considerations of entropy fluxes, or isentropic mass fluxes, and their different magnitudes in the troposphere and stratosphere. The dynamical constraint is based on a relation between isentropic mass fluxes and eddy fluxes of potential vorticity and surface potential temperature and on diffusive eddy flux closures. It takes baroclinic eddy fluxes as central for determining the extratropical tropopause height and thermal stratification and relates the tropopause potential temperature approximately linearly to the surface potential temperature and its gradient. Simulations with an idealized GCM point to the possibility of an extratropical climate in which baroclinic eddy fluxes maintain a statically stable thermal stratification and, in interaction with large-scale diabatic processes, lead to the formation of a sharp tropopause. The simulations show that the extratropical tropopause height and thermal stratification are set locally by extratropical processes and do not depend on tropical processes and that, across a wide range of atmospheric circulations, the dynamical constraint describes the relation between tropopause and surface potential temperatures well. An analysis of observational data shows that the dynamical constraint, derived for an idealized dry atmosphere, can account for interannual variations of the tropopause height and thermal stratification in the extratropics of the earth's atmosphere. The dynamical constraint implies that if baroclinic eddies determine the tropopause height and thermal stratification, an atmosphere organizes itself into a state in which nonlinear interactions among eddies are inhibited. The inhibition of nonlinear eddy-eddy interactions offers an explanation for the historic successes of linear and weakly nonlinear models of large-scale extratropical dynamics.},

As in earlier studies, tropical precipitation in response to high-latitude forcing is skewed toward the warmed hemisphere. Comparisons with a comprehensive GCM in an identical aquaplanet, mixed-layer framework reveal that the tropical responses tend to be much larger in the comprehensive GCM as a result of positive cloud and water vapor feedbacks that amplify the imposed extratropical thermal forcing. The magnitude of the tropical precipitation response in the idealized model is sensitive to convection scheme parameters. This sensitivity as well as the tropical precipitation response can be understood from a simple theory with two ingredients: the changes in poleward energy fluxes are predicted using a ...},

The high percentiles of daily precipitation increase as the climate warms. Their fractional rate of increase with global-mean surface temperature is generally similar to or greater than that of mean precipitation, but it is less than that of atmospheric (column) water vapor content. A simple scaling is introduced for precipitation extremes that accounts for their behavior by including the effects of changes in the moist-adiabatic lapse rate, the circulation strength, and the temperature when the extreme events occur. The effects of changes in the moist-adiabatic lapse rate and circulation strength on precipitation extremes are important globally, whereas the difference in the mean temperature and the temperature at which precipitation extremes occur is important only at middle to high latitudes.},

abstract = {Tropical cyclone size remains an unsolved problem in tropical meteorology, yet size plays a significant role in modulating damage. This work employs the Bryan cloud model (CM1) to systematically explore the sensitivity of the structure of an axisymmetric tropical cyclone at statistical equilibrium to the set of relevant model, initial, and environmental external parameters. The analysis is performed in a highly idealized state of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) governed by only four thermodynamic parameters, which are shown to modulate the storm structure primarily via modulation of the potential intensity. Using dimensional analysis, the authors find that the equilibrium radial wind profile is primarily a function of a single nondimensional parameter given by the ratio of the storm radial length scale to the parameterized eddy radial length scale. The former is found to be the ratio of the potential intensity to the Coriolis parameter, matching the prediction for the "natural" storm length scale embedded within prevailing axisymmetric tropical cyclone theory; the Rossby deformation radius is shown not to be fundamental. Beyond this primary scaling, a second nondimensional parameter representing the nondimensional Ekman suction velocity is found to modulate the far outer wind field. Implications of the primary nondimensional parameter are discussed, including the critical role of effective turbulence in modulating inner-core structure and new insight into empirical estimates of the radial mixing length.},

abstract = {The Tropical Warm Pool–International Cloud Experiment (TWP-ICE) provided extensive observational data sets designed to initialize, force, and constrain atmospheric model simulations. In this first of a two-part study, precipitation and cloud structures within nine cloud-resolving model simulations are compared with scanning radar reflectivity and satellite infrared brightness temperature observations during an active monsoon period from 19 to 25 January 2006. Seven of nine simulations overestimate convective area by 20{\%} or more leading to general overestimation of convective rainfall. This is balanced by underestimation of stratiform rainfall by 5{\%} to 50{\%} despite overestimation of stratiform area by up to 65{\%} because of a preponderance of very low stratiform rain rates in all simulations. All simulations fail to reproduce observed radar reflectivity distributions above the melting level in convective regions and throughout the troposphere in stratiform regions. Observed precipitation-sized ice reaches higher altitudes than simulated precipitation-sized ice despite some simulations that predict lower than observed top-of-atmosphere infrared brightness temperatures. For the simulations that overestimate radar reflectivity aloft, graupel is the cause with one-moment microphysics schemes whereas snow is the cause with two-moment microphysics schemes. Differences in simulated radar reflectivity are more highly correlated with differences in mass mean melted diameter (Dm) than differences in ice water content. Dm is largely dependent on the mass-dimension relationship and gamma size distribution parameters such as size intercept (N0) and shape parameter ($\mu$). Having variable density, variable N0, or $\mu$ greater than zero produces radar reflectivities closest to those observed.},

abstract = {The High Altitude Ice Crystals {\&}ndash; High Ice Water Content (HAIC-HIWC) joint field campaign produced aircraft retrievals of total condensed water content (TWC), hydrometeor particle size distributions (PSDs), and vertical velocity (w) in high ice water content regions of mature and decaying tropical mesoscale convective systems (MCSs). The resulting dataset is used here to explore causes of the commonly documented high bias in radar reflectivity within cloud-resolving simulations of deep convection. This bias has been linked to overly strong simulated convective updrafts lofting excessive condensate mass but is also modulated by parameterizations of hydrometeor size distributions, single particle properties, species separation, and microphysical processes. Observations are compared with three Weather Research and Forecasting model simulations of an observed MCS using differing microphysics while controlling for w, TWC, and temperature. Two bulk microphysics schemes (Thompson and Morrison) and one bin microphysics scheme (Fast Spectral Bin Microphysics) are compared. For temperatures between {\&}minus;10{\&}thinsp;°C and {\&}minus;40{\&}thinsp;°C and TWC{\&}thinsp;{\textgreater}{\&}thinsp;1{\&}thinsp;g{\&}thinsp;m{\&}minus;3 inside updrafts, all microphysics schemes produce median mass diameters (MMDs) that are generally larger than observed, and the precipitating ice species that controls this size bias varies by scheme, temperature, and w.

Although more mass is distributed to relatively large particle sizes relative to observed across all schemes when controlling for temperature, w, and TWC, differences with observations for a given particle size vary greatly between schemes. As a result, this bias is hypothesized to partly result from errors in parameterized hydrometeor PSD and single particle properties, but because it is present in all schemes, it may also partly result from errors in parameterized microphysical processes present in all schemes. Because of these ubiquitous ice size biases, microphysical parameterizations inherently produce a high bias in convective reflectivity for a wide range of temperatures, vertical velocities, and TWCs.},

@article{trenberth1991,
abstract = {The extent to which mass is conserved in European Centre for Medium Range Weather Forecasts (ECMWF) analyses archived on pressure surfaces is examined from two perspectives and with two different datasets. The data used come from the WMO archive of 7-level, twice daily initialized analyses and from the WCRP archive of 14-level, four-times daily uninitialized analyses. The first perspective, which considers the equation of continuity in pressure coordinates locally in three dimensions, reveals spurious residuals in the equation of up to 100{\%} of the size of the divergence term, with largest errors of 60{\%} to 100{\%} in the tropics. In this case the horizontal velocity and vertical p-velodty () fields are checked for consistency. Modest improvements occur when 14 versus 7 levels are used. The second perspective considers the vertical integral in which the surface pressure tendency should balance the total mass convergence into a column, and thus does not involve the omega fields. The latter reveals that the dominant residual is due to the failure to resolve the semidiurnal tide with only twice-daily data, so that a large-scale wavenumber 2 pattern with maxima in the tropics results as a residual. However, there are also many smaller scale and smaller amplitude features in the residual that cannot be explained simply. The residuals from the uninitialized analyses are much larger so that while four-times daily data removes much of the wavenumber 2 semidiurnal tide structure, the total residuals are just as large as with the twice-daily initialized data. Improvements in using 14 levels versus 7 are marginal for the vertical integral. The moisture budget, which is an important part of the overall mass budget, produces plausible estimates of vertically integrated evaporation minus precipitation, but needs to be validated.The primary source of the mass imbalance arises from the methods of postprocessing the variables onto pressure surfaces. Because sophisticated four-dimensional data assimilation now performs analyses of fields on model (sigma) surfaces, the postprocessing performs interpolations (using splines under tension) from model coordinates to pressure coordinates, with the result that the archived variables are really representative of individual levels rather than finite-sized layers. The implications are that residuals computed in other budgets, such as diabatic heating from the thermodynamic equation, will also include large errors, most of which will, however, be systematic.The effects of several common approximations in the treatment of the lower boundary on mass conservation are examined, and proper accounting for the full variations in both space and time of surface pressure on vertical mass integrals lead to the computation of kinematic orographic forcing from the analyses as a residual. The diagnosed lower boundary-induced vertical motions are weak and do not reveal the strong dipole patterns normally expected, which may indicate that the planetary waves are not adequately forced in the forecast model used in the four-dimensional data assimilation.},

abstract = {Abstract A quasi-geostrophic $\beta$-plane channel model is used to study wave-mean flow interaction in the stratosphere. The zonal mean circulation in the model is driven by differential radiative heating (parameterized in terms of a “Newtonian cooling”) and by horizontal eddy heat fluxes due to vertically propagating planetary waves excited by steady forcing at the lower boundary. We find that for sufficiently low-amplitude wave forcing the response is a steady stratospheric circulation very close to radiative equilibrium conditions. However, when the wave forcing is raised beyond a critical amplitude (typically of order 150 m) the response is no longer steady; rather, the mean zonal flow and eddy components oscillate quasi-periodically. We conclude that oscillations in stratospheric long waves do not necessarily reflect oscillating tropospheric forcing but may occur even in the presence of steady forcing.},

Organized by the Working Group on Numerical Experimentation as a contribution to the World Climate Research Programme, AMIP involves the international atmospheric modeling community in a major test and intercomparison of model performance; in addition to an agreed-to set of monthly averaged output variables, each of the participating models will generate a daily history of state. These data will be stored and made available in standard format by the Program for Climate Model Diagnosis and Intercomparison at the Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory. Following completion of the computational phase of AMIP in 1993, emphasis will shift to a series of diagnostic sub-projects, now being planned, for the detailed examination of model performance and the simulation of specific physical processes and phenomena. AMIP offers an unprecedented opportunity for the comprehensive evaluation and validation of current atmospheric models, and is expected to provide valuable information for model improvement.},

This intercomparison uses sea surface temperature change as a surrogate for climate change. The interpretation of cloud-climate interactions is given special attention. A roughly threefold variation in one measure of global climate sensitivity is found among the 19 models. The important conclusion is that most of this variation is attributable to differences in the models' depiction of cloud feedback, a result that emphasizes the need for improvements in the treatment of clouds in these models if they are ultimately to be used as reliable climate predictors. It is further emphasized that cloud feedback is the consequence of all interacting physical and dynamical processes in a general circulation model. The result of these processes is to produce changes in temperature, moisture distribution, and clouds which are integrated into the radiative response termed cloud feedback.},

In 21st century projections, models with large Arctic amplification have strong surface albedo and longwave cloud feedbacks, but only weak increases (or even decreases) in total energy transport into the Arctic. Enhanced Arctic warming weakens the equator-to-pole temperature gradient and decreases atmospheric dry static energy transport, a decrease that often outweighs increases from atmospheric moisture transport and ocean heat transport. Model spread in atmospheric energy transport cannot explain model spread in polar amplification; models with greater polar amplification must instead have stronger local feedbacks. Because local feedbacks affect temperature gradients, coupling between energy transports and Arctic feedbacks cannot be neglected when studying Arctic amplification. Citation: Hwang, Y.-T., D. M. W.

The increase in CAPE implies a systematic deviation of the thermal stratification from moist adiabatic that is non-negligible at high temperatures. However, cloud buoyancy remains much smaller than what CAPE would imply because entrainment is more effective in reducing buoyancy in warmer atmospheres. An entraining plume model in the limit of zero cloud buoyancy is shown to reproduce the increase in CAPE with warming if the entrainment rate is held fixed and increases in the vertical extent of convection are taken into account. These model results together with radiosonde observations are used to support a conceptual model in which entrainment plays a role in determining the thermal stratification of the tropical atmosphere.},

Here we present a refined decomposition that separately considers changes in free tropospheric and low cloud properties, better connecting feedbacks to individual governing processes and avoiding ambiguities present in a commonly-used decomposition. It reveals that three net cloud feedback components are robustly nonzero: positive feedbacks from increasing free tropospheric cloud altitude and decreasing low cloud cover and a negative feedback from increasing low cloud optical depth. Low cloud amount feedback is the dominant contributor to spread in net cloud feedback, but its anti-correlation with other components damps overall spread. The ensemble mean free tropospheric cloud altitude feedback is roughly 60{\%} as large as the standard cloud altitude feedback because it avoids aliasing in low cloud reductions. Implications for the “null hypothesis” climate sensitivity from well-understood and robustly-simulated feedbacks are discussed.},

abstract = {This work describes the formulation and climatology of an atmospheric general circulation model (GCM) of intermediate complexity, based on a spectral primitive-equation dynamical core and a set of simplified physical parametrization schemes. The parametrization package has been specially designed to work in models with just a few vertical levels, and is based on the same physical principles adopted in the schemes of state-of-the art GCMs. The parametrized processes include large-scale condensation, convection, clouds, short-wave and long-wave radiation, surface fluxes and vertical diffusion. In the current configuration, the model (nicknamed SPEEDY, from Simplified Parametrizations, primitivE-Equation DYnamics") has five vertical levels and a spectral truncation at total wave number 30 (T30L5). The top vertical level (crudely) represents the stratosphere, the bottom one the planetary boundary layer. Computationally, SPEEDY requires (at least) one order of magnitude less CPU time than a state-of-the-art GCM at the same horizontal resolution, and is therefore suitable for studies of inter-decadal or inter-centennial variability. Statistics of the model mean state and variability are computed from an ensemble of 41-year simulations forced by observed sea-surface temperatures in the period 1952-1992. The model mean state is closer to the observed climatology during the (boreal) winter than during summer. In winter (i.e. December to February, DJF), the model underestimates the amplitude of the Northern Hemisphere stationary wave pattern, particularly in the European-Atlantic sector. Some aspects of the systematic error of SPEEDY are in fact typical of many GCMs, although the error amplitude is, stronger than in state-of-the-art models. On the other hand, the global distribution of precipitation in DJF is quite realistic, and compares well with that of more complex GCMs. In summer (June to August), a strong negative bias in the mid-tropospheric temperature generates a Northern Hemisphere circulation with some springtime characteristics. In particular, the position of the Tropical Convergence Zone in the Indian Ocean remains too far south, leading to a deficient simulation of the monsoon circulation over South Asia. The simulated variability during the northern winter is reasonably realistic as far as the spatial distribution is concerned, although some underestimation in the intensity can be found, particularly in the low-frequency range and in the Atlantic sector. The atmospheric response to ENSO events is also weaker than observed, although the spatial patterns of the rainfall and geopotential response in the Pacific sector are in phase with their observed counterparts. In the Atlantic/Eurasian region, the spatial patterns associated with the interdecadal trends in the simulated and observed large-scale circulation show a clear positive correlation, consistent with the hypothesis of a positive ocean-atmosphere feedback on decadal time scales},

Output from the Clouds On–Off Klimate Intercomparison Experiment (COOKIE) is used to examine the impact of cloud radiative effects on circulation and climate. In aquaplanet simulations with a fixed SST pattern, the cloud radiative effect leads to an equatorward contraction of the intertropical convergence zone (ITCZ) and a reduction of the double ITCZ problem. It is shown that the cloud radiative heating in the upper troposphere increases the temperature, weakens CAPE, and inhibits the onset of convection until it is closer to the equator, where SSTs are higher. Precipitation peaks at higher values in a narrower band when the cloud radiative effects are active, compared to when they are inactive, owing to the enhancement in moisture convergence.

One mode of organization found is “self-aggregation,” in which moist convection spontaneously organizes into one or several isolated clusters despite spatially homogeneous boundary conditions and forcing. Self-aggregation is driven by interactions between clouds, moisture, radiation, surface fluxes, and circulation, and occurs in a wide variety of idealized simulations of radiative–convective equilibrium. Here we provide a review of convective self-aggregation in numerical simulations, including its character, causes, and effects. We describe the evolution of self-aggregation including its time and length scales and the physical mechanisms leading to its triggering and maintenance, and we also discuss possible links to climate and climate change.},

The simulated intraseasonal variability also transitions from an episodic phenomenon to one with a semiregular period of 25 days. Moist static energy (MSE) budgets of composite MJO events are used to diagnose the physical processes responsible for the relationship with SST. This analysis points to an increasingly positive contribution from vertical advection, associated in part with a steepening of the mean vertical MSE profile in the lower troposphere.

abstract = {The comprehensive general circulation model ECHAM6 is used in a radiative-convective equi- librium configuration. It is coupled to a perfectly conducting slab. To understand the local impact of thermo- dynamic surface properties on the land-ocean warming contrast, the surface latent heat flux and surface heat capacity are reduced stepwise, aiming for a land-like climate. Both ocean-like and land-like RCE simula- tion reproduce the tropical atmosphere over ocean and land in a satisfactory manner and lead to reasona- ble land-ocean warming ratios. A small surface heat capacity induces a high diurnal surface temperature range which triggers precipitation during the day and decouples the free troposphere from the diurnal mean temperature. With increasing evaporation resistance, the net atmospheric cooling rate decreases because cloud base height rises, causing a reduction of precipitation. Climate sensitivity depends more on changes in evaporation resistance than on changes in surface heat capacity. A feedback analysis with the partial radiation perturbation method shows that amplified warming over idealized land can be associated with disproportional changes in the lapse rate versus the water vapor feedback. Cloud feedbacks, convec- tive aggregation, and changes in global mean surface temperature confuse the picture.},

abstract = {As part of an international intercomparison project, a set of single-column models (SCMs) and cloud-resolving models (CRMs) are run under the weak-temperature gradient (WTG) method and the damped gravity wave (DGW) method. For each model, the implementation of the WTG or DGW method involves a simulated column which is coupled to a reference state defined with profiles obtained from the same model in radiative-convective equilibrium. The simulated column has the same surface conditions as the reference state and is initialized with profiles from the reference state. We performed systematic comparison of the behavior of different models under a consistent implementation of the WTG method and the DGW method and systematic comparison of the WTG and DGW methods in models with different physics and numerics. CRMs and SCMs produce a variety of behaviors under both WTG and DGW methods. Some of the models reproduce the reference state while others sustain a large-scale circulation which results in either substantially lower or higher precipitation compared to the value of the reference state. CRMs show a fairly linear relationship between precipitation and circulation strength. SCMs display a wider range of behaviors than CRMs. Some SCMs under the WTG method produce zero precipitation. Within an individual SCM, a DGW simulation and a corresponding WTG simulation can produce different signed circulation. When initialized with a dry troposphere, DGW simulations always result in a precipitating equilibrium state. The greatest sensitivities to the initial moisture conditions occur for multiple stable equilibria in some WTG simulations, corresponding to either a dry equilibrium state when initialized as dry or a precipitating equilibrium state when initialized as moist. Multiple equilibria are seen in more WTG simulations for higher SST. In some models, the existence of multiple equilibria is sensitive to some parameters in the WTG calculations.},

abstract = {Abstract A class of model for simulation and theory of the tropical atmospheric component of climate variations is introduced. These models are referred to as quasi-equilibrium tropical circulation models, or QTCMs, because they make use of approximations associated with quasi-equilibrium (QE) convective parameterizations. Quasi-equilibrium convective closures tend to constrain the vertical temperature profile in convecting regions. This can be used to generate analytical solutions for the large-scale flow under certain approximations. A tropical atmospheric model of intermediate complexity is constructed by using the analytical solutions as the first basis function in a Galerkin representation of vertical structure. This retains much of the simplicity of the analytical solutions, while retaining full nonlinearity, vertical momentum transport, departures from QE, and a transition between convective and nonconvective zones based on convective available potential energy. The atmospheric model is coupled to ...},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} 2016 Royal Meteorological Society.Cold pools of air, which are formed by evaporating precipitation, play a critical role in the triggering of new precipitation. Despite their recognized importance, little effort has been devoted to building simple models of their dynamics. Here, analytical equations are derived for the radius, height, and buoyancy of a cylindrical cold pool as a function of time, and a scale analysis reveals that entrainment is a dominant influence. These governing equations yield simple expressions for the maximum sizes and lifetimes of cold pools. The terminal radius of a cold pool is relatively insensitive to its initial conditions, with a typical maximum radius of about 14 times the initial radius, give or take a factor of 2. The terminal time of a cold pool, on the other hand, can vary over orders of magnitude depending on its initial potential and kinetic energies. These predictions are validated against large-eddy simulations.},

abstract = {Deep moist atmospheric convection is a key element of the weather and climate system for transporting mass, momentum, and thermal energy. It has been challenging to simulate convection realistically in global atmospheric models because of the large gap in spatial scales between convection (100 km) and global motions (104 km). We conducted the first ever subkilometer global simulation and described the features of convection. Through a series of grid-refinement resolution testing, we found that an essential change for convection statistics occurred around 2 km grid spacing. The convection structure, number of convective cells, and distance to the nearest convective cell dramatically changed at this resolution. The convection core was resolved using multiple grids in simulations with grid spacings less than 2.0 km.},

These differences in sensitivity of surface temperature to forcing can be explained in terms of a forcing-dependent lapse-rate feedback.},

@article{donner2016,
abstract = {Both climate forcing and climate sensitivity persist as stubborn uncertainties limiting the extent to which climate models can provide actionable scientific scenarios for climate change. A key, explicit control on cloud-aerosol interactions, the largest uncertainty in climate forcing, is the vertical velocity of cloud-scale updrafts. Model-based studies of climate sensitivity indicate that convective entrainment, which is closely related to updraft speeds, is an important control on climate sensitivity. Updraft vertical velocities also drive many physical processes essential to numerical weather prediction. Vertical velocities and their role in atmospheric physical processes have been given very limited attention in models for climate and numerical weather prediction. The relevant physical scales range down to tens of meters and are thus frequently sub-grid and require parameterization. Many state-of-science convection parameterizations provide mass fluxes without specifying vertical velocities, and parameterizations which do provide vertical velocities have been subject to limited evaluation against what have until recently been scant observations. Atmospheric observations imply that the distribution of vertical velocities depends on the areas over which the vertical velocities are averaged. Distributions of vertical velocities in climate models may capture this behavior, but it has not been accounted for when parameterizing cloud and precipitation processes in current models. New observations of convective vertical velocities offer a potentially promising path toward developing process-level cloud models and parameterizations for climate and numerical weather prediction. Taking account of scale-dependence of resolved vertical velocities offers a path to matching cloud-scale physical processes and their driving dynamics more realistically, with a prospect of reduced uncertainty in both climate forcing and sensitivity.},

abstract = {Retrospective seasonal predictions of tropical cyclones (TCs) in the three major ocean basins of the Northern Hemisphere are performed from 1990 to 2010 using the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory High-Resolution Atmospheric Model (HiRAM) at 25-km resolution. Atmospheric states are initialized for each forecast, with the sea surface temperature anomaly (SSTA) “persisted” from that at the starting time during the 5-month forecast period (July–November). Using a five-member ensemble, it is shown that the storm counts of both tropical storm (TS) and hurricane categories are highly predictable in the North Atlantic basin during the 21-yr period. The correlations between the 21-yr observed and model predicted storm counts are 0.88 and 0.89 for hurricanes and TSs, respectively. The prediction in the eastern North Pacific is skillful, but it is not as outstanding as that in the North Atlantic. The persistent SSTA assumption appears to be less robust for the western North Pacific, contributing to less skillful predictions in that region. The relative skill in the prediction of storm counts is shown to be consistent with the quality of the predicted large-scale environment in the three major basins. It is shown that intensity distribution of TCs can be captured well by the model if the central sea level pressure is used as the threshold variable instead of the commonly used 10-m wind speed. This demonstrates the feasibility of using the 25-km-resolution HiRAM, a general circulation model designed initially for long-term climate simulations, to study the impacts of climate change on the intensity distribution of TCs.},

abstract = {Public attitudes about climate change reveal a contradiction. Surveys show most Americans believe climate change poses serious risks but also that reductions in greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions sufficient to stabilize atmospheric GHG concentrations can be deferred until there is greater evidence that climate change is harmful. US policymakers likewise argue it is prudent to wait and see whether climate change will cause substantial economic harm before undertaking policies to reduce emissions. Such wait-and-see policies erroneously presume climate change can be reversed quickly should harm become evident, underestimating substantial delays in the climates response to anthropogenic forcing. We report experiments with highly educated adults graduate students at MIT showing widespread misunderstanding of the fundamental stock and flow relationships, including mass balance principles, that lead to long response delays. GHG emissions are now about twice the rate of GHG removal from the atmosphere. GHG concentrations will therefore continue to rise even if emissions fall, stabilizing only when emissions equal removal. In contrast, most subjects believe atmospheric GHG concentrations can be stabilized while emissions into the atmosphere continuously exceed the removal of GHGs from it. These beliefs analogous to arguing a bathtub filled faster than it drains will never overflow support wait-and-see policies but violate conservation of matter. Low public support for mitigation policies may arise from misconceptions of climate dynamics rather than high discount rates or uncertainty about the impact of climate change. Implications for education and communication between scientists and nonscientists (the public and policymakers) are discussed.},

abstract = {AbstractThis study compares next-day forecasts of storm motion from convection-allowing models with 1- and 4-km grid spacing. A tracking algorithm is used to determine the motion of discrete storms in both the model forecasts and an analysis of radar observations. The distributions of both the raw storm motions and the deviations of these motions from the environmental flow are examined to determine the overall biases of the 1- and 4-km forecasts and how they compare to the observed storm motions. The mean storm speeds for the 1-km forecasts are significantly closer to the observed mean than those for the 4-km forecasts when viewed relative to the environmental flow/shear, but mostly for the shorter-lived storms. For storm directions, the 1-km forecast storms move similarly to the 4-km forecast storms on average. However, for the raw storm motions and those relative to the 0–6-km shear, results suggest that the 1-km forecasts may alleviate some of a clockwise (rightward) bias of the 4-km forecasts, partic...},

abstract = {Abstract In mesoscale modeling the scale l of the energy- and flux-containing turbulence is much smaller than the scale $\Delta$ of the spatial filter used on the equations of motion, and in large-eddy simulation (LES) it is much larger. Since their models of the subfilter-scale (SFS) turbulence were not designed to be used when l and $\Delta$ are of the same order, this numerical region can be called the “terra incognita.” The most common SFS model, a scalar eddy diffusivity acting on the filtered fields, emerges from the conservation equations for SFS fluxes when several terms, including all but one of the production terms, are neglected. Analysis of data from the recent Horizontal Array Turbulence Study (HATS) shows that the neglected production terms can be significant. Including them in the modeled SFS flux equations yields a more general SFS model, one with a tensor rather than a scalar eddy diffusivity. This more general SFS model is probably not necessary in fine-resolution LES or in coarse-resolution mesoscale...},

An overview of preliminary results highlights the development of mid-latitude cyclones, the overall representation of global tropical convection, intense convective activity within the eye wall and outer rain bands of the 2009 Atlantic hurricane Bill validated by satellite observations, and the seasonal predictability of global tropical cyclone activity with realistic intensities.

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

The results show that it takes almost twice as long to reach the state of radiative convective equilibrium for the atmosphere with a given distribution of relative humidity than for the atmosphere with a given distribution of absolute humidity. Also, the surface equilibrium temperature of the former is almost twice as sensitive to change of various factors such as solar constant, CO2 content, O3 content, and cloudiness, than that of the latter, due to the adjustment of water vapor content to the temperature variation of the atmosphere. According to our estimate, a doubling of the CO2 content in the atmosphere has the effect of raising the temperature of the atmosphere (whose relative humidity is fixed) by about 2C. Our model does not have the extreme sensitivity of atmospheric temperature to changes of CO2 content which was adduced by M{\"{o}}ller.},

@article{Sardeshmukh2009,
abstract = {Linear stochastically forced models have been found to be competitive with comprehensive nonlinear weather and climate models at representing many features of the observed covariance statistics and at predictions beyond a week. Their success seems at odds with the fact that the observed statistics can be significantly non-Gaussian, which is often attributed to nonlinear dynamics. The stochastic noise in the linear models can be a mixture of state-independent (‘‘additive'') and linearly state-dependent (‘‘multiplicative'') Gaussian white noises. It is shown here that such mixtures can produce not only symmetric but also skewed non-Gaussian probability distributions if the additive and multiplicative noises are correlated. Such correlations are readily anticipated from first principles. A generic stochastically generated skewed (SGS) distribution can be analytically derived from the Fokker–Planck equation for a single-component system. In addition to skew, all such SGS distributions have power-law tails, as well as a striking property that the (excess) kurtosis K is always greater than 1.5 times the square of the skew S. Remarkably, this K–S inequality is found to be satisfied by circulation variables even in the observed multicomponent climate system. A principle of ‘‘diagonal dominance'' in the multicomponent moment equations is introduced to understand this behavior. To clarify the nature of the stochastic noises (turbulent adiabatic versus diabatic fluctuations) responsible for the observed non-Gaussian statistics, a long 1200-winter simulation of the northern winter climate is generated using a dry adiabatic atmospheric general circulation model forced only with the observed long-term wintermean diabatic forcing as a constant forcing. Despite the complete neglect of diabatic variations, the model reproduces the observed K–S relationships and also the spatial patterns of the skew and kurtosis of the daily tropospheric circulation anomalies. This suggests that the stochastic generators of these higher moments are mostly associated with local adiabatic turbulent fluxes. The model also simulates fifth moments that are approximately 10 times the skew, and probability densities with power-law tails, as predicted by the linear theory.},

This difference seems surprising because some GCMs can adequately reproduce the much longer twentieth- century surface-based land-mean precipitation record [Lambert et al., 2005]. Global precipitation changes are tied to the surface energy budget through evaporation and to the tropospheric energy budget through condensation. Thus, if GCMs do underestimate global precipitation changes, the simulation of other climate variables will be affected. Should GCM results be reevaluated in light of Wentz et al.'s [2007] findings? We find that 20-year trends are not directly com- parable to 100-year trends. Hence, observa- tions are not directly comparable to century- long GCM simulations [see also Previdi and Liepert, this issue]. Proper consideration is necessary of the physical processes poten- tially behind changes in the water cycle.},

This phenomenon is known as polar amplifica-tion. Understanding this equator-to-pole temperature gradient is fun-damental to climate and general circulation, yet there is no established theory from a perspective of the general circulation. Here, a general-circulation-based theory for polar amplification is presented.

abstract = {AbstractDespite the differences in the spatial patterns of the external forcing associated with a doubling CO2 and with a 2{\%} solar variability, the final responses in the troposphere and at the surface in a three-dimensional general circulation model appear remarkably similar. Various feedback processes are diagnosed and compared using the climate feedback?response analysis method (CFRAM) to understand the mechanisms responsible.At the surface, solar radiative forcing is stronger in the tropics than at the high latitudes, whereas greenhouse radiative forcing is stronger at high latitudes compared with the tropics. Also solar forcing is positive everywhere in the troposphere and greenhouse radiative forcing is positive mainly in the lower troposphere. The water vapor feedback strengthens the upward-decreasing radiative heating profile in the tropics and the poleward-decreasing radiative heating profile in the lower troposphere. The ?evaporative? and convective feedbacks play an important role only in the tropics where they act to reduce the warming at the surface and lower troposphere in favor of upper-troposphere warming. Both water vapor feedback and enhancement of convection in the tropics further strengthen the initial poleward-decreasing profile of energy flux convergence perturbations throughout the troposphere. As a result, the large-scale dynamical poleward energy transport, which acts on the negative temperature gradient, is enhanced in both cases, contributing to a polar amplification of warming aloft and a warming reduction in the tropics. The dynamical amplification of polar atmospheric warming also contributes additional warming to the surface below via downward thermal radiation.},

Over this time, an increase occurred in the amplitude of change of deep-ocean foraminiferal oxygen isotopic ratios, traditionally interpretedasdefiningthe main rhythm of ice ages although containing large effects of changes in deep-ocean temperature. We have separated the effects of decreasing temperature and increasing global ice volume on oxygen isotope ratios. Our results suggest that the MPT was initiated by an abrupt increase in Antarctic ice volume 900 thousand years ago. We see no evidence of a pattern of gradual cooling, but near-freezing temperatures occur at every glacial maximum. T},

The scientific objectives of {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCEMIP{\textless}/i{\textgreater} are three-fold. First, clouds and climate sensitivity will be investigated in the {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCE{\textless}/i{\textgreater} setting. This includes determining how cloud fraction changes with warming and the role of self-aggregation of convection. Second, {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCEMIP{\textless}/i{\textgreater} will quantify the dependence of the degree of convective aggregation and tropical circulation regimes on temperature. Finally, by providing a common baseline, {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCEMIP{\textless}/i{\textgreater} will allow the robustness of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCE{\textless}/i{\textgreater} state, cloud feedbacks, and convective aggregation across the spectrum of models to be assessed. A novel aspect and major advantage of {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCEMIP{\textless}/i{\textgreater} is the accessibility of the {\textless}i{\textgreater}RCE{\textless}/i{\textgreater} framework to a variety of models, including cloud-resolving models, general circulation models, global cloud-resolving models, and single column models.{\textless}/p{\textgreater}},

abstract = {Results are presented from a series of sensitivity tests in idealized global warming experiments using the global nonhydrostatic model, NICAM, in which convection at scales of 7–14 km is explicitly resolved. All have a strong positive longwave cloud feedback larger than that seen in conventional GCMs with parameterized convection. Consequently, the global mean net outgoing radiation decreases in response to increased sea surface temperatures. Large increases in high clouds with tops between 180 and 50 hPa are found, and these changes contribute the most to this longwave cloud feedback. Relative humidity and upper tropospheric temperature also increases strongly, again more so than typically seen in conventional GCMs. The magnitude of the response varies considerably between different versions of NICAM. Most of the NICAM control simulations show large overestimates in cloud fraction between 180 and 50 hPa compared to observations. The changes in cloud fraction in the upper troposphere are strongly correlated with their control values. Versions of NICAM with stronger cloud feedbacks have large positive biases in high-top cloud amount and temperature in the free troposphere in their control simulations. The version which has the best agreement with the observations in this regard has the weakest longwave cloud feedback; however, this is still more strongly positive than that typically seen in conventional GCMs. These results demonstrate the potential for stronger high cloud fraction feedbacks in climate warming scenarios than currently predicted by conventional GCMs and highlight the potential relevance of deep convective processes.},

abstract = {Carbonates capping Neoproterozoic glacial deposits contain peculiar sedimentological features and geochemical anomalies ascribed to extraordinary environmental conditions in the snowball Earth aftermath. It is commonly assumed that post-snowball climate dominated by CO2 partial pressures several hundred times greater than modern levels, would be characterized by extreme temperatures, a vigorous hydrological cycle, and associated high continental weathering rates. However, the climate in the aftermath of a global glaciation has never been rigorously modelled. Here, we use a hierarchy of numerical models, from an atmospheric general circulation model to a mechanistic model describing continental weathering processes, to explore characteristics of the Earth system during the supergreenhouse climate following a snowball glaciation. These models suggest that the hydrological cycle intensifies only moderately in response to the elevated greenhouse. Indeed, constraints imposed by the surface energy budget sharply limit global mean evaporation once the temperature has warmed sufficiently that the evaporation approaches the total absorbed solar radiation. Even at 400 times the present day pressure of atmospheric CO2, continental runoff is only 1.2 times the modern runoff. Under these conditions and accounting for the grinding of the continental surface by the ice sheet during the snowball event, the simulated maximum discharge of dissolved elements from continental weathering into the ocean is approximately 10 times greater than the modern flux. Consequently, it takes millions of years for the silicate weathering cycle to reduce post-snowball CO2 levels to background Neoproterozoic levels. Regarding the origin of the cap dolostones, we show that continental weathering alone does not supply enough cations during the snowball melting phase to account for their observed volume. {\textcopyright} 2008 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Joseph Smagorinsky (1924–2005) was a forceful and powerful figure in meteorology during the last half of the twentieth century. He served as director of the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) for nearly 30 yr (1955–83); and during his tenure as director, this organization substantially contributed to advances in weather forecasting and climate diagnostics/prediction. The purpose of this research is to explore Smagorinsky's philosophy of science and style of management which were central to the success of GFDL. Information herein comes from his early scientific publications, personal letters and notes in the possession of his family, several oral histories, and letters of reminiscence from scientists who worked within and outside GFDL.The principal results of the study are that 1) early inspiration and development of Smagorinsky's scientific philosophy came from his contact with Jule Charney and Harry Wexler, 2) his doctoral dissertation ideally prepared him for appointment as director of the U.S. Weather Bureau's long-range numerical prediction project in 1955—the General Circulation Research Section (later renamed GFDL), 3) he masterfully assembled a team of researchers to attack the challenging problem of general circulation modeling, and 4) he exhibited an authoritarian style of rule tempered by protection of the scientists from disrupting outside influence while celebrating the elitism and esprit de corps that characterized the laboratory.A list of Smagorinsky's management principles is found in the appendix. Several of these tenets have been interspersed in the main body of the paper in support of actions he took at GFDL.},

abstract = {This article discusses the role of geophysical fluid dynamics (GFD) in understanding the natural environment, and in particular the dynamics of atmospheres and oceans on Earth and elsewhere. GFD, as usually understood, is a branch of the geosciences that deals with fluid dynamics and that, by tradition, seeks to extract the bare essence of a phenomenon, omitting detail where possible. The geosciences in general deal with complex interacting systems and in some ways resemble condensed matter physics or aspects of biology, where we seek explanations of phenomena at a higher level than simply directly calculating the interactions of all the constituent parts. That is, we try to develop theories or make simple models of the behaviour of the system as a whole. However, these days in many geophysical systems of interest, we can also obtain information for how the system behaves by almost direct numerical simulation from the governing equations. The numerical model itself then explicitly predicts the emergent phenomena--the Gulf Stream, for example--something that is still usually impossible in biology or condensed matter physics. Such simulations, as manifested, for example, in complicated general circulation models, have in some ways been extremely successful and one may reasonably now ask whether understanding a complex geophysical system is necessary for predicting it. In what follows we discuss such issues and the roles that GFD has played in the past and will play in the future.},

However, this was preceded by a longer declining d15N trend that implies that the anoxic zone was shrinking for most of the 20th century.

If equatorial Pacific winds resume their predicted weakening trend, the ocean's largest anoxic zone will contract despite a global O2 decline.},

abstract = {Near-surface warming in the Arctic has been almost twice as large as the global average over recent decades-a phenomenon that is known as the 'Arctic amplification'. The underlying causes of this temperature amplification remain uncertain. The reduction in snow and ice cover that has occurred over recent decades may have played a role. Climate model experiments indicate that when global temperature rises, Arctic snow and ice cover retreats, causing excessive polar warming. Reduction of the snow and ice cover causes albedo changes, and increased refreezing of sea ice during the cold season and decreases in sea-ice thickness both increase heat flux from the ocean to the atmosphere. Changes in oceanic and atmospheric circulation, as well as cloud cover, have also been proposed to cause Arctic temperature amplification. Here we examine the vertical structure of temperature change in the Arctic during the late twentieth century using reanalysis data. We find evidence for temperature amplification well above the surface. Snow and ice feedbacks cannot be the main cause of the warming aloft during the greater part of the year, because these feedbacks are expected to primarily affect temperatures in the lowermost part of the atmosphere, resulting in a pattern of warming that we only observe in spring. A significant proportion of the observed temperature amplification must therefore be explained by mechanisms that induce warming above the lowermost part of the atmosphere. We regress the Arctic temperature field on the atmospheric energy transport into the Arctic and find that, in the summer half-year, a significant proportion of the vertical structure of warming can be explained by changes in this variable. We conclude that changes in atmospheric heat transport may be an important cause of the recent Arctic temperature amplification.},

abstract = {The IPCC AR4 global warming climate simulations reveal a pronounced seasonality of polar warming amplification with maximum warming amplification in winter and minimum in summer. In this paper, we study the relative importance of surface albedo feedback (SAF), changes in cloud radiative forcing (CRF), changes in surface sensible and latent heat fluxes, changes in heat storage, and changes in the clear-sky downward infrared radiation in causing the strong seasonality of polar warming amplification by calculating partial temperature changes due to each of these processes using the surface energy budget equation. The main thermodynamic factor for a small polar warming amplification in summer is that the positive SAF is largely cancelled out by the negative surface CRF feedback in summer. The positive SAF is relatively much weaker in winter compared to its amplitude in summer, therefore does not contribute to the pronounced polar warming amplification in winter. The seasonal cycle of polar surface warming amplification, in terms of both spatial patterns and temporal amplitude, closely follows the seasonal cycle of the warming due to changes in clear-sky downward longwave radiation alone, indicating the importance of the atmospheric processes, such as water vapor feedback and dynamical feedbacks associated with the enhancement of poleward moist static energy transport, in causing the pronounced seasonality of polar warming amplification.

abstract = {Arctic amplification, the observation that surface air temperature changes in the Arctic exceed those of the Northern Hemisphere as a whole, is a pervasive feature of climate models, and has recently emerged in observational data relative to the warming trend of the past century. The magnitude of Arctic amplification is an important, but poorly constrained variable necessary to estimate global average temperature change over the next century. Here we evaluate the mechanisms responsible for Arctic amplification on Quaternary timescales, and review evidence from four intervals in the past 3 Ma for which sufficient paleoclimate data and model simulations are available to estimate the magnitude of Arctic amplification under climate states both warmer and colder than present. Despite differences in forcings and feedbacks for these reconstructions compared to today, the Arctic temperature change consistently exceeds the Northern Hemisphere average by a factor of 3-4, suggesting that Arctic warming will continue to greatly exceed the global average over the coming century, with concomitant reductions in terrestrial ice masses and, consequently, an increasing rate of sea level rise. {\textcopyright} 2010 Elsevier Ltd.},

We explore this role in a two-dimensional numerical experiment on a simple moist convecting system consisting of an isolated long-lasting nonprecipitating cloud in a calm atmosphere with no surface forcing. The cloud develops a horizontally averaged density variation with height which is neutrally buoyant with respect to a moist adiabatic. The buoyancy difference between the cloud and the undisturbed sounding produces circulations that can be understood as spreading gravity waves which adjust the environmental buoyancy to be equal to the cloud buoyancy by compensating subsidence. Unlike the circulations inside clouds, this adjustment takes place without turbulent mixing. Hence, the “buoyancy adjustment time” T1 during which the environment comes into rough buoyant equilibrium with the clouds is much shorter than the “mixing time” T2 which it takes a tracer, initially concentrated at s...},

abstract = {The Reference Forward Model (RFM) is a general purpose line-by-line radiative transfer model, currently supported by the UK National Centre for Earth Observation. This paper outlines the algorithms used by the RFM, focusing on standard calculations of terrestrial atmospheric infrared spectra followed by a brief summary of some additional capabilities and extensions to microwave wavelengths and extraterrestrial atmospheres. At its most basic level — the ‘line-by-line' component — it calculates molecular absorption cross-sections by applying the Voigt lineshape to all transitions up to ±25 cm−1 from line-centre. Alternatively, absorptions can be directly interpolated from various forms of tabulated data. These cross-sections are then used to construct infrared radiance or transmittance spectra for ray paths through homogeneous cells, plane-parallel or circular atmospheres. At a higher level, the RFM can apply instrumental convolutions to simulate measurements from Fourier transform spectrometers. It can also calculate Jacobian spectra and so act as a stand-alone forward model within a retrieval scheme. The RFM is designed for robustness, flexibility and ease-of-use (particularly by the non-expert), and no claims are made for superior accuracy, or indeed novelty, compared to other line-by-line codes. Its main limitations at present are a lack of scattering and simplified modelling of surface reflectance and line-mixing.},

abstract = {Water vapour continuum absorption is an important contributor to the Earth's radiative cooling and energy balance. Here, we describe the development and status of the MT{\_}CKD (MlawerTobinCloughKneizysDavies) water vapour continuum absorption model. The perspective adopted in developing the MT{\_}CKD model has been to constrain the model so that it is consistent with quality analyses of spectral atmospheric and laboratory measurements of the foreign and self continuum. For field measurements, only cases for which the characterization of the atmospheric state has been highly scrutinized have been used. Continuum coefficients in spectral regions that have not been subject to compelling analyses are determined by a mathematical formulation of the spectral shape associated with each water vapour monomer line. This formulation, which is based on continuum values in spectral regions in which the coefficients are well constrained by measurements, is applied consistently to all water vapour monomer lines from the microwave to the visible. The results are summed-up (separately for the foreign and self) to obtain continuum coefficients from 0 to 20 000 cm(-1). For each water vapour line, the MT{\_}CKD line shape formulation consists of two components: exponentially decaying far wings of the line plus a contribution from a water vapour molecule undergoing a weak interaction with a second molecule. In the MT{\_}CKD model, the first component is the primary agent for the continuum between water vapour bands, while the second component is responsible for the majority of the continuum within water vapour bands. The MT{\_}CKD model should be regarded as a semi-empirical model with strong constraints provided by the known physics. Keeping the MT{\_}CKD continuum consistent with current observational studies necessitates periodic updates to the water vapour continuum coefficients. In addition to providing details on the MT{\_}CKD line shape formulation, we describe the most recent update to the model, MT{\_}CKD{\_}2.5, which is based on an analysis of satellite- and ground-based observations from 2385 to 2600 cm(-1) (approx. 4 $\mu$m).},

In the present paper, this approach is used to generate a set of suitable parameters and FORTRAN software for the calculation of absorption by CO2 under atmospheric conditions which can be easily included in radiance/transmission computer codes. This package which includes all bands of significant contribution to atmospheric spectra, is an extension, now accounting for all P, Q, and R lines, of the tools proposed previously for Q branches only.

abstract = {AbstractSurface temperatures increase at a greater rate over land than ocean in simulations and observations of global warming. It has previously been proposed that this land?ocean warming contrast is related to different changes in lapse rates over land and ocean because of limited moisture availability over land. A simple theory of the land?ocean warming contrast is developed here in which lapse rates are determined by an assumption of convective quasi-equilibrium. The theory predicts that the difference between land and ocean temperatures increases monotonically as the climate warms or as the land becomes more arid. However, the ratio of differential warming over land and ocean varies nonmonotonically with temperature for constant relative humidities and reaches a maximum at roughly 290 K.The theory is applied to simulations with an idealized general circulation model in which the continental configuration and climate are varied systematically. The simulated warming contrast is confined to latitudes below 50° when climate is varied by changes in longwave optical thickness. The warming contrast depends on land aridity and is larger for zonal land bands than for continents with finite zonal extent. A land?ocean temperature contrast may be induced at higher latitudes by enforcing an arid land surface, but its magnitude is relatively small. The warming contrast is generally well described by the theory, although inclusion of a land?ocean albedo contrast causes the theory to overestimate the land temperatures. Extensions of the theory are discussed to include the effect of large-scale eddies on the extratropical thermal stratification and to account for warming contrasts in both surface air and surface skin temperatures.},

On seasonal and longer timescales, the ITCZ migrates, typically towards a warming hemisphere but with exceptions, such as during El Ni{\~{n}}o events. An emerging framework links the ITCZ to the atmospheric energy balance and may account for ITCZ variations on timescales from years to geological epochs.},

abstract = {Radiative forcing of a homogeneous greenhouse gas (HGG) can be very inhomogeneous because the forcing is dependent on other atmospheric and surface variables. In the case of doubling CO2, the monthly mean instantaneous forcing at the top of the atmosphere is found to vary geographically and temporally from positive to negative values, with the range (−2.5 – 5.1 W m−2) being more than three times the magnitude of the global mean value (2.3 W m−2). The vertical temperature change across the atmospheric column (temperature lapse rate) is found to be the best single predictor for explaining forcing variation. In addition, the masking effects of clouds and water vapor also contribute to forcing inhomogeneity. A regression model that predicts forcing from geophysical variables is constructed. This model can explain more than 90{\%} of the variance of the forcing. Applying this model to analyzing the forcing variation in the CMIP5 models, we find that inter-model discrepancy in CO2 forcing caused by model climatology leads to considerable discrepancy in their projected change in poleward energy transport.},

abstract = {Convective self-aggregation refers to a phenomenon in cloud-resolving simulations wherein the atmosphere spontaneously develops a circulation with a convecting moist patch and a nonconvecting dry patch. All previous studies have found a sharp transition to aggregated convection when the domain size exceeds a critical threshold, typically in the range of 200–300 km. Here, we show that cold pools are responsible for this sharp transition. When cold pools are inhibited, self-aggregation occurs at all domain sizes. In this case, the aggregation strength decreases smoothly as the domain size L is decreased below about 200–300 km. A streamfunction analysis reveals two distinct sources for the air subsiding into the dry-patch boundary layer: a moist, shallow circulation and a dry, deep circulation. The deep circulation scales with L, whereas the shallow circulation does not. At small L, the shallow circulation dominates, thereby weakening the aggregation.},

abstract = {The radiative constraints on the partitioning of the surface energy budget and, hence, on the strength of the hydrological cycle are analyzed in an idealized one-dimensional radiative–convective equilibrium model formulated in terms of the energy budgets at the top of the atmosphere, the subcloud layer, and the free atmosphere, which enables it to predict both surface relative humidity and the air–sea temperature difference. Using semigray radiative transfer, a semianalytical solution was obtained that explicitly shows how the surface latent heat flux (LHF) is related to the radiative properties of the atmosphere. This solution was also used in conjunction with a full radiative transfer code and was found to provide reasonably realistic quantitative estimates. In the model the LHF is fundamentally constrained by the net longwave flux divergence above the level of condensation by lifting (LCL) and by the atmospheric absorption of shortwave radiation, with only a weak indirect control by near-surface moisture. The latter implies that the Clausius–Clapeyron relation does not directly constrain the strength of the hydrological cycle. Under radiative perturbations, the changes in LHF are determined by the changes in the net longwave fluxes at the LCL, associated mainly with the changes in the longwave transmissivity, and by the changes in shortwave absorption by the atmosphere (e.g., by increased water vapor). Using a full radiative transfer model with interactive water vapor feedback with the semianalytical solution indicates a rate of change in LHF with greenhouse forcing of around 2 W m2 K1 of surface warming, which corresponds to the Planck feedback (3.2Wm2 K1) multiplied by a coefficient of order one that, to first approximation, depends only on the relative magnitudes of the net longwave radiation fluxes at the LCL and the top of the atmosphere (i.e., on the shape of the vertical profile of the net long- wave flux).},

The modeling framework consists of 30 simulations with the Community Earth System Model (CESM) at 1° latitude–longitude resolution, each of which is subject to an identical scenario of historical radiative forcing but starts from a slightly different atmospheric state. Hence, any spread within the ensemble results from unpredictable internal variability superimposed upon the forced climate change signal. Constructed atmospheric circulation analogs are used to estimate the dynamical contribution to forced and internal components of SAT trends: thermodynamic contributions are obtained as a residual.

abstract = {A new mechanism is proposed to explain the 100,000-year timescale for variations in Antarctic temperatures and atmospheric CO2 over the last 650,000 years. It starts with fluctuations in the oceanic overturning around Antarctica that release CO2 up to the atmosphere or trap it in the deep ocean. Every 50,000 years one of these fluctuations coincides with a changeover in the burial of CaCO3 in the deep ocean. The changeover alters the atmospheric pCO2 in a way that augments the tendency of the overturning. The augmented overturning then enhances the tendency of theCaCO3 burial, which augments the overturning, etc. In this way, an individual random fluctuation becomes one of the big transitions seen in the Antarctic ice cores. Alternating transitions toward the warm and cold states every 50,000 years produce the 100,000-year timescale. The 50,000-year time interval is set by the turnover time forCO3 burial of CaCO3 on the seafloor. = ions in the ocean with respect to theCO2-induced weathering of silicate rocks and the},

abstract = {We present the global and regional hydrological sensitivity (HS) to surface temperature changes, for perturbations to CO 2 , CH 4 , sulfate and black carbon concentrations, and solar irradiance. Based on results from ten climate models, we show how modeled global mean precipitation increases by 2–3{\%} per kelvin of global mean surface warming, independent of driver, when the effects of rapid adjustments are removed. Previously reported differences in response between drivers are therefore mainly ascribable to rapid atmospheric adjustment processes. All models show a sharp contrast in behavior over land and over ocean, with a strong surface temperature-driven (slow) ocean HS of 3–5{\%}/K, while the slow land HS is only 0–2{\%}/K. Separating the response into convective and large-scale cloud processes, we find larger inter-model differences, in particular over land regions. Large-scale precipitation changes are most relevant at high latitudes, while the equatorial HS is dominated by convective precipitation changes. Black carbon stands out as the driver with the largest inter-model slow HS variability, and also the strongest contrast between a weak land and strong sea response. We identify a particular need for model investigations and observational constraints on convective precipitation in the Arctic, and large-scale precipitation around the Equator.},

abstract = {The water vapour continuum is characterised by absorption that varies smoothly with wavelength, from the visible to the microwave. It is present within the rotational and vibrational-rotational bands of water vapour, which consist of large numbers of narrow spectral lines, and in the many 'windows' between these bands. The continuum absorption in the window regions is of particular importance for the Earth's radiation budget and for remote-sensing techniques that exploit these windows. Historically, most attention has focused on the 8-12 mu m (mid-infrared) atmospheric window, where the continuum is relatively well-characterised, but there have been many fewer measurements within bands and in other window regions. In addition, the causes of the continuum remain a subject of controversy. This paper provides a brief historical overview of the development of understanding of the continuum and then reviews recent developments, with a focus on the near-infrared spectral region. Recent laboratory measurements in near-infrared windows, which reveal absorption typically an order of magnitude stronger than in widely used continuum models, are shown to have important consequences for remote-sensing techniques that use these windows for retrieving cloud properties.},

abstract = {Simulations with climate models show a land-ocean contrast in the response of P - E (precipitation minus evaporation or evapotranspiration) to global warming, with larger changes over ocean than over land. The changes over ocean broadly follow a simple thermodynamic scaling of the atmospheric moisture convergence: the so-called wet-get-wetter, dry-get-drier mechanism. Over land, however, the simple scaling fails to give any regions with decreases in P - E, and it overestimates increases in P - E compared to the simulations. Changes in circulation cause deviations from the simple scaling, but they are not sufficient to explain this systematic moist bias. It is shown here that horizontal gradients of changes in temperature and fractional changes in relative humidity, not accounted for in the simple scaling, are important over land and high-latitude oceans. An extended scaling that incorporates these gradients is shown to better capture the response of P - E over land, including a smaller increase in global-mean runoff and several regions with decreases in P - E. In the zonal mean over land, the gradient terms lead to a robust drying tendency at almost all latitudes. This drying tendency is shown to relate, in part, to the polar amplification of warming in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the amplified warming over continental interiors and on the eastern side of midlatitude continents.},

We present idealized GCM simulations of a Walker circulation forced by prescribed ocean heat-flux convergence in a slab ocean, where the longwave opacity of the atmosphere is varied to simulate a wide range of climates. The weakening of the Walker circulation with warming results from an increase in gross moist stability (GMS), a measure of the tropospheric moist-static-energy (MSE) stratification, which provides an effective static stability for tropical circulations. Baroclinic-mode theory is used to determine changes in GMS in terms of the tropical-mean profiles of temperature and MSE. The GMS increases with warming, due primarily to the rise in tropopause height, decreasing the sensitivity of the...},

abstract = {Over the last 25 years, the focus of operational numerical weather prediction has evolved from that of estimating the most likely evolution of weather to that of estimating probability distributions of future weather associated with inevitable uncertainties in both initial conditions and model equations. This evolution from determinism to uncertainty has not only increased the scientific rigor of weather prediction, it has also increased the value of weather forecasts for users. In addition, it has opened up a new approach to solving the equations of motion, likely to be of importance for both weather and climate prediction in an age where high-performance computing is limited by power consumption. However, despite all this, the numerical weather prediction community has yet to embrace fully the concept of the primacy of doubt. It is now time to take the final step in this direction. The evolution of numerical weather forecasting, from its formulation as a scientific initial value problem at the beginning of the 20th century, to today's complex numerical models has been described in the accu-rately titled review: ''The quiet revolution of numerical weather prediction'' [Bauer et al., 2015]. Here it is shown how the skill of deterministic ''best-guess'' weather forecasts in the range from 3 to 10 days ahead has improved by about a day a decade: today's 6 day forecast being as skillful as a 5 day forecast 10 years ago. There are several reasons for this increase in skill. First, the numerical models themselves have become more accurate representations of the underlying equations of motion, partly because advances in super-computer technology have allowed the basic resolution of the numerical grids to become finer, and partly because parameterized representations of unresolved processes (such as clouds, radiation, and small-scale orographic drag) have improved. In addition, the advent of satellite data in the last decades of the 20th cen-tury has enabled much more accurate estimates of global initial conditions to be made, but only after 4-D variational data assimilation schemes which can assimilate satellite radiances directly into the models had been developed.},

But rapid progress is now within reach. New computational tools and methods from data assimilation and machine learning make it possible to integrate global observations and local high-resolution simulations in an Earth system model (ESM) that systematically learns from both. Here we propose a blueprint for such an ESM. We outline how parameterization schemes can learn from global observations and targeted high-resolution simulations, for example, of clouds and convection, through matching low-order statistics between ESMs, observations, and high-resolution simulations. We illustrate learning algorithms for ESMs with a simple dynamical system that shares characteristics of the climate system; and we discuss the opportunities the proposed framework presents and the challenges that remain to realize it.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {The climatology, seasonality, and intraseasonal to interannual variability of the temperature field near the cold-point tropopause (CPT) are examined using the state-of-the-art climate models that participated in the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Both historical simulations and future projections based on the Representative Concentration Pathway (RCP) 8.5 scenario are used to evaluate model performance and to identify potential changes in the CPT temperature, which is estimated using both the 100-hPa and zero-lapse-rate (ZLR) temperatures. It is found that historical simulations successfully reproduce the spatio-temporal structure of the CPT temperature in comparison to reanalysis data. The interannual variability associated with El Ni{\~{n}}o-Southern Oscillation and intraseasonal variability associated with equatorial waves are also reasonably well captured. However, the models show non-negligible biases in several aspects: 1) most models have a warm bias around the CPT; 2) large inter-model differences occur in the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in 100-hPa temperature; 3) several models overestimate lower stratospheric warming in response to volcanic aerosols; 4) temperature variability associated with the quasi-biennial oscillation and Madden-Julian oscillation is absent in most models; 5) equatorial waves near the CPT exhibit a wide range of variations among the models with unrealistically persistent Kelvin waves in several models. In the RCP 8.5 scenario, the models predict robust warming both at the 100-hPa and ZLR levels, but cooling at the 70-hPa level. A weakened seasonal cycle in the temperature is also predicted in most models at both the 100- and 70-hPa levels. These findings may have important implications for cross-tropopause water vapor transport and related global climate change and variability.},

abstract = {This paper investigates changes in the tropical tropopause layer (TTL) in response to carbon dioxide increase and surface warming separately in an atmospheric general circulation model, finding that both effects lead to a warmer tropical tropopause. Surface warming also results in an upward shift of the tropopause. A detailed heat budget analysis is performed to quantify the contributions from different radiative and dynamic processes to changes in the TTL temperature. When carbon dioxide increases with fixed surface temperature, a warmer TTL mainly results from the direct radiative effect of carbon dioxide increase. With surface warming, the largest contribution to the TTL warming comes from the radiative effect of the warmer troposphere, which is partly canceled by the radiative effect of the moistening at the TTL. Strengthening of the stratospheric circulation following surface warming cools the lower stratosphere dynamically and radiatively via changes in ozone. These two effects are of comparable magnitudes. This circulation change is the main cause of temperature changes near 63 hPa but is weak near 100 hPa. Contributions from changes in convection and clouds are also quantified. These results illustrate the heat budget analysis as a useful tool to disentangle the radiative-dynamical-chemical-convective coupling at the TTL and to facilitate an understanding of intermodel difference.},

abstract = {Key climate feedback due to water vapor and clouds rest largely on how relative humidity {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} changes in a warmer climate, yet this has not been extensively analyzed in models. General circulation models (GCMs) from the CMIP3 archive and several higher-resolution atmospheric GCMs examined here generally predict a characteristic pattern of {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} trend with global temperature that has been reported previously in individual models, including increase around the tropopause, decrease in the tropical upper troposphere, and decrease in midlatitudes. This pattern is very similar to that previously reported for cloud cover in the same GCMs, confirming the role of {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} in controlling changes in simulated cloud. Comparing different models, the trend in each part of the troposphere is approximately proportional to the upward and/or poleward gradient of {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} in the present climate. While this suggests that the changes simply reflect a shift of the {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} pattern upward with the tropopause and poleward with the zonal jets, the drying trend in the subtropics is roughly 3 times too large to be attributable to shifts of subtropical features, and the subtropical {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} minima deepen in most models. {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} trends are correlated with horizontal model resolution, especially outside the tropics, where they show signs of convergence and latitudinal gradients become close to available observations for GCM resolutions near T85 and higher. We argue that much of the systematic change in {\$}\backslashcal{\{}R{\}}{\$} can be explained by the local specific humidity having been set (by condensation) in remote regions with different temperature changes, hence the gradients and trends each depend on a model's ability to resolve moisture transport. Finally, subtropical drying trends predicted from the warming alone fall well short of those observed in recent decades. While this discrepancy supports previous reports of GCMs underestimating Hadley cell expansion, our results imply that shifts alone are not a sufficient interpretation of changes.},

The feedbacks from clouds and surface albedo are also found to be positive in all models, while the only stabilizing (negative) feedback comes from the temperature response. Large intermodel differences in the lapse rate feedback are observed and shown to be associated with differing regional patterns of surface warming. Consistent with previous studies, it is found that the vertical changes in temperature and water vapor are tightly coupled in all models and, importantly, dem- onstrate that intermodel differences in the sum of lapse rate and water vapor feedbacks are small. In contrast, intermodel differences in cloud feedback are found to provide the largest source of uncertainty in current predictions of climate sensitivity.},

abstract = {In response to increasing atmospheric con- centrations of greenhouse gases, the rate of time- dependent climate change is determined jointly by the strength of climate feedbacks and the eciency of pro- cesses which remove heat from the surface into the deep ocean. This work examines the vertical heat transport processes in the ocean of the HADCM2 atmosphere± ocean general circulation model (AOGCM) in experi- ments with CO2 held constant (control) and increasing at 1{\%} per year (anomaly). The control experiment shows that global average heat exchanges between the upper and lower ocean are dominated by the Southern Ocean, where heat is pumped downwards by the wind- driven circulation and diuses upwards along sloping isopycnals. This is the reverse of the low-latitude balance used in upwelling±diusion ocean models, the global average upward diusive transport being against the temperature gradient. In the anomaly experiment, weakened convection at high latitudes leads to reduced diffusive and convective heat loss from the deep ocean, and hence to net heat uptake, since the advective heat input is less aected. Reduction of deep water produc- tion at high latitudes results in reduced upwelling of cold water at low latitudes, giving a further contribution to net heat uptake. On the global average, high-latitude processes thus have a controlling in¯uence. The impor- tant role of diusion highlights the need to ensure that the schemes employed in AOGCMs give an accurate representation of the relevant sub-grid-scale processes.},

In this part, the general analytical solution of the system is given and two idealized climate change scenarios, one with a step forcing and one with a linear forcing, are discussed. These solutions give a didactic description of the contributions from the equilibrium response and of the fast and slow transient responses during a climate transition. Based on these analytical solutions, a simple and physically based procedure to calibrate the two-layer model parameters using anAOGCMstep-forcing experiment is introduced. Using this procedure, the global thermal properties of 16 AOGCMs participating in phase 5 of the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP5) are determined. It is shown that, for a givenAOGCM,theEBMtuned with only the abrupt 43CO2 experiment is able to reproduce with a very good accuracy the temperature evolution in both a step-forcing and a linear-forcing experiment. The role of the upper-ocean and deep-ocean heat uptakes in the fast and slow responses is also discussed. One of the main weaknesses of the simple EBM discussed in this part is its ability to represent the evolution of the top-of-the-atmosphere radiative imbalance in the transient regime.

In those models with a deeper and stronger AMOC, a smaller portion of the heat anomaly remains in the ocean mixed layer, and consequently, the surface temperature response is delayed. Representations of AMOC differ vastly across the GCMs, providing a major source of intermodel spread in the sea surface temperature (SST) response. A two-layer model fit to the GCMs is used to demonstrate that the intermodel spread in SSTs due to variations in the ocean's effective heat capacity is significant but smaller than the spread due to climate feedbacks.},

abstract = {It has been pointed out that climatological- mean precipitation-evaporation difference (P–E) should increase under global warming mainly through the increasing saturation level of moisture. This study focuses on evaporation changes under global warming and their dependency on the direct warming effect, on the basis of future projections from the Coupled Model Intercompari- son Project Phase 5 (CMIP5). Over most of the tropical, subtropical and midlatitude regions, the direct contribution from surface temperature increase is found to dominate the projected increase in evaporation. This contribution is nevertheless offset partially, especially over the oceans, by contributions from weakening surface winds and increasing near-surface relative humidity. Greater warming of surface air than of the sea surface also acts to reduce surface evaporation, by reducing both the exchange coefficient and humidity contrast at the surface. Though generally of secondary importance, this contribution is the dominant factor over the subpolar oceans. Over the polar oceans, the effect of sea-ice retreat dominantly contributes to the evaporation increase in winter, whereas the reduced exchange coefficient and surface humidity contrast coupled with the sea-ice retreat account for most of the response during summertime. Over the continents, changes in the surface exchange coefficient, reflecting changes in soil moisture and vegetation among other factors, are importan to modulate the direct effects of the warming and the generally reduced surface air relative humidity},

abstract = {The atmosphere is critical to climate change. It can amplify shifts in the climate system, and also mitigate them. This primer offers an introduction to these atmospheric processes and how they work, written by a leading expert on the subject. In an overview of key atmospheric processes, the author looks at how our climate system receives energy from the sun and sheds it by emitting infrared radiation back into space. The atmosphere regulates these radiative energy flows and transports energy through weather systems such as thunderstorms, monsoons, hurricanes, and winter storms. He explains how these processes work, and also how precipitation, cloud formation, and other phase changes of water strongly influence weather and climate. He discusses how atmospheric feedbacks affect climate change, how the large-scale atmospheric circulation works, how predicting the weather and the climate are fundamentally different challenges, and much more. This primer is an introduction to atmospheric processes and the vital role they play in our climate system. Basics -- Radiative energy flows -- How turbulence and cumulus clouds carry energy upward ; More about eddy fluxes -- How energy travels from the tropics to the poles ; Conservation of momentum on a rotating sphere -- Feedbacks -- The water planet -- Predictability of weather and climate -- Air, sea, land -- Frontiers.},

One of these, in which the thermal sensitivity is computed using the assumption that heating by dynamical processes is unaffected by changed composition, gives results which generally are in excellent agreement with those from the GCM. Exceptions to this occur in the ozone reduction experiment at the tropical tropopause and the tropical mesosphere. The predicted response to the ozone reduction is largest at 50 km in the tropics, where the temperature decreases by 25 K; at the tropical tropopause, the decrease is 5 K. The carbon dioxide increase results in a 10 K decrease at 50 km, decreasing to zero at the tropopause. The temperature change in the CO, experiment is remarkably uniform in latitude.},

The system is run into a state of statistical equilibrium for a range of imposed tropospheric radiative cooling rates. The heat budget implies that there should be a larger cloud mass flux for increasing radiative cooling; it does not exclude the possibility of more intense updrafts, but does not require it. In the numerical simulations, it is found that the increase of cloud areal coverage accounts for all the increase of the cloud mass flux required to balance an increase of the radiative cooling rate. At equilibrium, the mean updraft velocity in the clouds is independent of the magnitude of the radiative forcing.},

abstract = {Useful guidance on how much warming to expect requires estimates of uncertainties in climate projections. In its 2007 assessment report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) placed a wide uncertainty range on possible climate trajectories for the coming century. Since then, several studies have implied that the lower half of this range is more plausible than the upper half1,2, so a re-evaluation of the high end of projected temperature increases is particularly important. Writing in Nature Geoscience, Rowlands and colleagues6 conclude that by 2050, global mean temperatures are likely to be 1.4 to 3 °C warmer than during the period 1960–1990, if greenhouse gas emissions continue along a pathway without mitigation but with some reductions in sulphate aerosols. More than a dozen climate modelling groups around the world have provided their best attempts at simulating climate over the twenty-first century and beyond — for a variety of emissions scenarios — to the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project (CMIP). This archive of model results has been utilized for the 2007 IPCC report as well as national climate assessments. These models differ in a host of ways, ranging from their treatments of small-scale moist convection to aerosol–cloud interactions and ocean mixing processes. Motivated in part by the small size and unsystematic character of the CMIP ensembles, some groups have moved towards creating 'perturbed physics' ensembles by starting with one model and systematically perturbing parameters. In this way, they have created much larger sets of climate model projections3,4,5{\textgreater}. The CMIP and perturbed physics ensembles are complementary, and it is a challenge to optimally combine these resources with expert opinion to provide the most meaningful estimates of uncertainty. Climate modelling is not sufficiently advanced to have reached agreement on the set of key model parameters that are uncertain yet critical, and that designers of a model ensemble should therefore focus on. Expert advice is required on the choice of which set of parameters to vary. There is no claim that these are all of the relevant uncertain parameters, or that there are no further, structural uncertainties in the model that cannot be expressed as simple parameter variations. The resulting range of simulations must then be narrowed to those that are deemed plausible, based on comparison with key observations. This comparison determines the extent to which projections from each model version deserve to be considered as part of the distribution of plausible outcomes. The definition of this filter through which the models must pass is critical to the interpretation of the results. Rowlands et al.6 analyse projections from thousands of distinct climate models, under a typical scenario of greenhouse gas emissions with no mitigation. They use the simulations generated through climateprediction.net7, the most ambitious of the efforts at perturbed physics simulations, run on computers of volunteers around the world. Selecting those models that they consider sufficiently realistic, they find that no model that passes their quality control warms less than 1 °C by 2050 as compared with their 1960–1990 baseline. On the other hand, a surprisingly large fraction (about 15{\%}) of these models warm by as much as 3 °C. This work marks a significant technical advance over previous publications by this group: it is based on projections with a very large set of fully coupled atmosphere–ocean models suitable for studying the transient non-equilibrium climate states relevant for century-scale projections. However, to prevent unrealistic drifts in control simulations, artificial energy fluxes are imposed at the air–sea interface. These flux adjustments vary seasonally, but are otherwise independent of time. To define their filter for model quality control, Rowlands et al.6 use the evolution of surface temperatures in more than 20 land regions and ocean basins over the past 50 years, as well as the global mean magnitude of the required flux adjustment. Many other metrics could be contemplated for this purpose; for example, estimates of ocean heat content variations or various aspects of the observed seasonal cycle. However, the global warming in this model ensemble does not seem to be sensitive to changes in the ocean parameters, and the use of seasonally varying flux adjustments precludes a straightforward use of the observed seasonal cycle as a metric. Some of the models that pass the quality control employed by Rowlands and colleagues6 may exhibit other disqualifying features in their mean climates, akin to the unrealistic stratospheric water vapour concentrations and water vapour feedback that characterizes extreme members in some other perturbed physics ensembles5,8{\textgreater}. According to the authors, the ability of their high response models to pass through the imposed filter is typically not a consequence of a balance between exceptionally large aerosol forcing and large climate sensitivity. If it is not aerosol cooling, then internal variability must mask the large responses to increasing greenhouse gases over the period of observational constraints, to enable the models to pass the quality control. But the ability of internal variability to hide underlying forced trends is likely to decrease as the time period analysed gets longer. Indeed, the authors suggest that tests against observed temperature evolution over a longer time period might reduce the viability of some of their current high-end models. Rowlands and colleagues6 consider an ensemble of unprecedented size in their study, but it is nevertheless important to think of the results as a work in progress while questions of how best to confront each model with observations are addressed. Their massive perturbed physics ensemble is a valuable resource for further analysis of climate change. Eventually, it may help us not only to quantify uncertainty, but also to reduce it.

The tracers are used to diagnose the correlations between a parcel's state above the cloud base and both the parcel's state at the cloud base and its entrainment history. The correlation with the cloud-base state goes to zero a few hundred meters above the cloud base. On the other hand, correlations between a parcel's state and its net entrainment are large. Evidence is found that the entrainment events may be described as a stochastic Poisson process. A parcel model is constructed with stochastic entrainment that is able to replicate the mean and standard deviation of cloud properties. Turning off cloud-base variability has little effect on the results, which suggests that stochastic mass-flux models may be initialized with a single set of properties.

abstract = {Global efforts to mitigate climate change are guided by projections of future temperatures. But the eventual equilibrium global mean temperature associated with a given stabilization level of atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations remains uncertain, complicating the setting of stabilization targets to avoid potentially dangerous levels of global warming. Similar problems apply to the carbon cycle: observations currently provide only a weak constraint on the response to future emissions. Here we use ensemble simulations of simple climate-carbon-cycle models constrained by observations and projections from more comprehensive models to simulate the temperature response to a broad range of carbon dioxide emission pathways. We find that the peak warming caused by a given cumulative carbon dioxide emission is better constrained than the warming response to a stabilization scenario. Furthermore, the relationship between cumulative emissions and peak warming is remarkably insensitive to the emission pathway (timing of emissions or peak emission rate). Hence policy targets based on limiting cumulative emissions of carbon dioxide are likely to be more robust to scientific uncertainty than emission-rate or concentration targets. Total anthropogenic emissions of one trillion tonnes of carbon (3.67 trillion tonnes of CO 2), about half of which has already been emitted since industrialization began, results in a most likely peak carbon-dioxide-induced warming of 2°C above pre-industrial temperatures, with a 5-95{\%} confidence interval of 1.3-3.9°C. {\textcopyright} 2009 Macmillan Publishers Limited.},

abstract = {The global temperature response to increasing atmospheric CO(2) is often quantified by metrics such as equilibrium climate sensitivity and transient climate response. These approaches, however, do not account for carbon cycle feedbacks and therefore do not fully represent the net response of the Earth system to anthropogenic CO(2) emissions. Climate-carbon modelling experiments have shown that: (1) the warming per unit CO(2) emitted does not depend on the background CO(2) concentration; (2) the total allowable emissions for climate stabilization do not depend on the timing of those emissions; and (3) the temperature response to a pulse of CO(2) is approximately constant on timescales of decades to centuries. Here we generalize these results and show that the carbon-climate response (CCR), defined as the ratio of temperature change to cumulative carbon emissions, is approximately independent of both the atmospheric CO(2) concentration and its rate of change on these timescales. From observational constraints, we estimate CCR to be in the range 1.0-2.1 degrees C per trillion tonnes of carbon (Tt C) emitted (5th to 95th percentiles), consistent with twenty-first-century CCR values simulated by climate-carbon models. Uncertainty in land-use CO(2) emissions and aerosol forcing, however, means that higher observationally constrained values cannot be excluded. The CCR, when evaluated from climate-carbon models under idealized conditions, represents a simple yet robust metric for comparing models, which aggregates both climate feedbacks and carbon cycle feedbacks. CCR is also likely to be a useful concept for climate change mitigation and policy; by combining the uncertainties associated with climate sensitivity, carbon sinks and climate-carbon feedbacks into a single quantity, the CCR allows CO(2)-induced global mean temperature change to be inferred directly from cumulative carbon emissions.},

By comparing several climate models from the World Climate Research Programme (WCRP) Coupled Model Intercomparison Project phase 3 (CMIP3) database under idealized CO2 forcings, it is shown that differences in the increase in global atmospheric shortwave heating (SWabs) induced by clear-sky absorption, presumably by water vapor, partly explains this spread. The increases in SWabs and LH present similar spreads across models but are anticorrelated, so the sum SWabs {\&}43; LH increases more robustly than either alone. This is consistent with a recently proposed theory (Takahashi) that predicts that this sum (or, equivalently, the net longwave divergence minus the surface sensible heat flux) is constrained by energy conservation and robust longwave physics.The intermodel scatter in SWabs changes is explained neither by differences in the radiative transfer models nor in intermodel differences in global water vapor content change, but perhaps by more subtle aspects of the changes in the water vapor distribution. Nevertheless, the fact that the radiative transfer models generally underestimate the increase in SWabs relative to the corresponding line-by-line calculation for a given change in water vapor content suggests that the climate models might be overestimating the rate of increase in the global hydrological cycle with global warming.},

abstract = {The concentration of CO2 in the atmosphere is a key influence on Earth's climate. Today, significant quantities of CO2 are emitted at continental rifts, suggesting that the spatial and temporal extent of rift systems may have influenced deep carbon fluxes and thus climate change throughout geological time. Here we test this hypothesis by conducting a worldwide census of continental rift lengths over the last 200 million years. We estimate tectonic CO2 release rates through time and show that along the extensive Mesozoic and Cenozoic rift systems, rift-related CO2 degassing rates reached more than 300{\%} of present-day values. Using a numerical carbon cycle model, we find that two prominent periods of enhanced rifting 160 to 100 million years ago and after 55 million years ago coincided with greenhouse climate episodes, during which atmospheric CO2 concentrations were more than three times higher than today. We therefore propose that continental fragmentation and long-term climate change could plausibly be linked via massive CO2 degassing in rift systems. Degassing of large amounts of CO2 from continental rifts may have contributed to greenhouse climate episodes over the past 200 million years, according to numerical models.},

abstract = {Tropical cloud and circulation changes are large sources of uncertainty in future climate change. This problem owes partly to the scale separation between large-scale tropical dynamics (∼104 km) and convective dynamics (∼1 km), which generally requires parameterizing convection in models that resolve large-scale dynamics, or parameterizing (or omitting) large-scale dynamics in models that permit convection. Here we discuss simulations of radiative-convective equilibrium (RCE) across a wide range of surface temperatures in long channel geometry – where the domain size and resolution marginally resolve both large-scale dynamics and convection. Self-aggregation of convection in these simulations spontaneously produces realistic dynamical regimes of large-scale vertical motion. The circulation weakens with surface warming but changes in the degree of self-aggregation depend on the metric that is used; there is no obvious trend in aggregation with warming. Surface warming causes an upward shift and decrease in area of high clouds, and a sharp decline in mid-level clouds, but no systematic trend in low cloud cover. We introduce a method for approximate radiative kernel feedback analysis in RCE, and apply it to both simulations in long channel geometry and in a smaller square domain. The kernel-corrected cloud feedback is positive but its magnitude varies across temperatures. Compared to simulations that do not have aggregation, there is a more negative net feedback due to the effects of aggregation on relative humidity and cloud cover. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that self-aggregation moderately reduces climate sensitivity.},

abstract = {Although the distribution of sunshine is symmetrical about the equator, the earth's climate is not. Climatic asymmetries are prominent in the eastern tropical Pacific and Atlantic Oceans where the regions of maximum sea surface temperature, convective cloud cover, and rainfall are north of the equator. This is the result of two sets of factors: interactions between the ocean and atmosphere that are capable of converting symmetry into asymmetry, and the geometries of the continents that determine in which longitudes the interactions are effective and in which hemisphere the warmest waters and the intertropical convergence zone are located. The ocean-atmosphere interactions are most effective where the thermocline is shallow because the winds can readily affect sea surface temperatures in such regions. The thermocline happens to shoal in the eastern equatorial Pacific and Atlantic, but not in the eastern Indian Ocean, because easterly trade winds prevail over the tropical Atlantic and Pacific whereas monsoons, with a far larger meridional component, are dominant over the Indian Ocean. That is how the global distribution of the continents, by determining the large-scale wind patterns, causes climatic asymmetries to be prominent in some bands of longitude but not others. The explanation for asymmetries that favor the Northern rather than Southern Hemisphere with the warmest waters and the ITCZ involves the details of the local coastal geometries: the bulge of western Africa to the north of the Gulf of Guinea and the slope of the western coast of the Americas relative to meridians.

abstract = {Increasing greenhouse gas concentrations are expected to enhance the interannual variability of summer climate in Europe and other mid-latitude regions, potentially causing more frequent heatwaves. Climate models consistently predict an increase in the variability of summer temperatures in these areas, but the underlying mechanisms responsible for this increase remain uncertain. Here we explore these mechanisms using regional simulations of recent and future climatic conditions with and without land-atmosphere interactions. Our results indicate that the increase in summer temperature variability predicted in central and eastern Europe is mainly due to feedbacks between the land surface and the atmosphere. Furthermore, they suggest that land-atmosphere interactions increase climate variability in this region because climatic regimes in Europe shift northwards in response to increasing greenhouse gas concentrations, creating a new transitional climate zone with strong land-atmosphere coupling in central and eastern Europe. These findings emphasize the importance of soil-moisture-temperature feedbacks (in addition to soil-moisture-precipitation feedbacks) in influencing summer climate variability and the potential migration of climate zones with strong land-atmosphere coupling as a consequence of global warming. This highlights the crucial role of land-atmosphere interactions in future climate change.},

Efforts to narrow this distribution by weighting projections according to measures of model fidelity have so far failed, largely because climate sensitivity is independent of current measures of skill in current ensembles of models. This work presents a cautionary example showing that measures of model fidelity that are effective at narrowing the distribution of future projections (because they are systematically related to climate sensitivity in an ensemble of models) may be poor measures of the likelihood that a model will provide an accurate estimate of climate sensitivity (and thus degrade distributions of projections if they are used as weights). Furthermore, it appears unlikely that statistical tests alone can identify robust measures of likelihood.

To study some processes that contribute to this asymmetry about the equator, we use a two-dimensional model which neglects zonal variations and consists of an ocean model with a mixed layer coupled to a simple atmospheric model. In this coupled model, the atmosphere not only transports momentum into the ocean, but also directly affects sea surface temperature by means of wind stirring and surface latent heat flux. Under equatorially symmetric conditions, the model has, in addition to an equatorially symmetric solution, two asymmetric solutions with a single ITCZ that forms in only one hemisphere. Strong equatorial upwelling is essential for the asymmetry. Local oceanic turbulent processes involving vertical mixing and surface latent heat flux, which are dependent on wind speed, also contribute to the asymmetry.},

abstract = {Past cold climates are often thought to have been “drier” than today on land, which appears to conflict with recent studies projecting widespread terrestrial drying with near-future warming. However, other work has found that over large portions of the continents, the conclusion of future “drying” vs. “wet- ting” strongly depends on the physical property of interest. Here, we show that this also holds in simulations of the Last Glacial Maximum: the conti- nents have generally wetter topsoils and higher values of standard climate- wetness metrics than in the preindustrial, as well as generally lower precipi- tation and ubiquitously lower photosynthesis (likely driven by the low CO2), with streamflow responses falling in between. Using a large existing global pollen and plant-fossil compilation, we also confirm that LGM grasslands and open woodlands grew at many sites of present-day forest, seasonal forests at many sites of present-day rainforest, and so forth, while changes in the opposite sense were few and spatially con- fined. These vegetation changes resemble the model photosynthesis responses but not the hydroclimate responses, while published lake-level changes resem- ble the latter but not the former. Thus, confidence in both the model hydro- logic and photosynthesis projections is increased, and there is no significant conflict. Instead, paleo- and modern climate researchers must carefully de- fine “wetting” and “drying,” and in particular should not assume hydrologic drying on the basis of vegetation decline, or vegetation stress on the basis of declines in hydroclimatic indicators.},

There was outward flow in the updraughts of individual thermals at most levels and there were usually downdraughts observed at the edges of the updraught or of the cloud. Widespread inward flow towards the centre of the cloud and a narrow, but strong, updraught was occasionally observed, reminiscent of the tail found at the rear of the laboratory thermals. A region of reduced liquid water content was frequently observed in the centre of several thermals where the updraught and horizontal 1D divergence were strongest, and complete holes were observed on two occasions. Although horizontal wind shear was generally weak, it was significant in a few cases, causing the flow pattern in the cloud to be asymmetric. Ascending regions of cloud with high values of liquid water content (cloud cores) were commonly observed at all altitudes, but generally the percentage of clouds measured with high liquid water content decreased with altitude. The observations of airflow and liquid water content structure in warm cumulus clouds described in this paper are consistent with the schematic model of a thermal where a core of high liquid water content survives for several kilometres above cloud base, but erodes as it ascends.},

abstract = {A comprehensive review of theoretical and numerical models of cumulus clouds and moist convective systems is presented. The problem of modeling cumulus convection encompasses an extremely broad range of physical and dynamic processes. On the microphysical scale a number of critical problems remain to be solved. In the case of deep, supercooled cumuli, for example, the uncertainties of ice particle production and cloud glaciation severely limit one's ability to model quantitatively the physics and dynamics of supercooled cumuli. As a consequence of the speed and space limitations of present generation computers, much of the effort of modeling cumulus convection is concerned with the subject of parameterization. Not only does this include parameterization of the essential microphysics of cumuli but also the parameterization of the energetics and fluxes of the eddies not explicitly resolved by the model. The limitations of present generation computers become most apparent when one acknowledges that the problem of modeling deep, moist convection is fully three-dimensional and that such systems are often in direct communication with larger-scale (mesoscale and synoptic-scale) meteorological systems.},

The formulation leads to qualitatively good results with the resolution provided by about 1500 grid points, but it has not yet been possible to exhibit the shape-preserving stage assumed in theoretical treatments and found approximately by laboratory experiments.

abstract = {A differential equation is formulated for the rate of rise of isolated buoyant elements in the atmosphere, based in part on analogy with the work of Davies and Taylor (1950) who studied the ascent of air bubbles in liquid. The equation involves a drag force which is proportional to the ascent velocity squared and which depends upon a linear dimension of the buoyant element, such as the radius of curvature of its upper surface. To eliminate this dimension from the differential equation, a law for the erosion, or rate of decrease in size of these buoyant air bubbles has been proposed. The basic assumptions are that the elements erode sufficiently slowly so that the flow around them is nearly the same as if they were in equilibrium, and that they retain their shape. From combination of the erosion law and the equation of motion, an erosion parameter, E, is derived, which to the extent that the laws are valid should be constant for all isolated cloudy bubbles, regardless of air mass or location. The erosion constant has been expressed in terms of the bubble's upward velocity, acceleration, and its buoyancy. The theory is thus subject to test in the case of cumulus towers, by simple measurements from time-lapse motion pictures and an environmental temperature sounding. Observations of twelve relatively isolated cumulus bubbles, selected from both the trade-wind region and middle latitudes, show that E is indeed constant within the limits of measurement. A case of the aggregation of several small bubbles into a larger one is also studied, and the applicability to it of the same erosion and drag laws is established. The interaction of bubbles with one another, and with the environment to form large cumulus clouds, is discussed qualitatively.},

abstract = { ABSTRACT A kinematic model of the flow around and into a buoyant$\backslash$n{\&}lsquo;thermal{\&}rsquo; is discussed in some detail, and compared with$\backslash$nexisting laboratory observations. The basic assumption is that the$\backslash$nflow is instantaneously the same as it is for Hill{\&}apos;s spherical$\backslash$nvortex of fixed size moving through a frictionless fluid. The equations$\backslash$ndescribing the motion of a particle have been modified to allow for$\backslash$nan expansion in radius proportional to the distance travelled, and$\backslash$na numerical integration of these time-dependent equations has been$\backslash$nperformed in order to find particle trajectories, with respect to$\backslash$nboth the instantaneous boundary of the spherical vortex and axes$\backslash$nat rest. It is shown that for the expanding vortex there is no quantity$\backslash$ncorresponding to the {\&}lsquo;drift distance{\&}rsquo; or the total forward$\backslash$ndisplacement of particles in the flow round a sphere of constant$\backslash$nsize; particles in the wake of an expanding vortex have a finite$\backslash$nforward velocity at large times.The model gives very close agreement$\backslash$nwith the observed behaviour of particles entering a turbulent buoyant$\backslash$nthermal, except that in the laboratory measurements the region containing$\backslash$nthe turbulent fluid resembles an oblate spheroid rather than a sphere.$\backslash$nThe thin mixing layer over the front and the addition of fluid over$\backslash$na broad region at the rear of a thermal, as well as the detailed$\backslash$nparticle trajectories, can all be explained as consequences of this$\backslash$nmean velocity distribution. },

The concentration of mixed fluid in the far field of a “classical” thermal is approximately uniform, whereas the near field is dominated by a moderately diluted toroidal core. The effects of atmospheric evaporative cooling on thermals were simulated by using chemicals with nonlinear buoyancy-reversing behavior. Even though the trajectory of an “evaporating” thermal depends strongly on a buoyancy-reversal parameter, the minimum mixing rate is not greatly modified. A simple derivation, based on the self-similar properties of thermals, provides the minimum molecular-scale mixing rate, which agrees with the measurements. These observations may enhance the understanding of cumulus clouds in weakly stratified environments.},

abstract = {A newly developed technique for airborne dual-Doppler observations with the Wyoming Cloud Radar is used to characterize the velocity fields in vertical planes across cumulus turrets. The clouds sampled were continental in nature, with high bases (near 0 degrees C) and with depths of 2-3 km. Clear evidence was found that the clouds evolved through sequences of bubbles, or thermals. with well-defined toroidal circulations, or vortex rings. The ring core and tube diameters were about 200-600 m, leading to turret sizes of 1-2 km in the horizontal. The largest updraft speeds were observed in the ring centers, but regions of turbulent, ascending air extended behind the thermals to distances comparable with the toroid sizes. Vertical shear of ambient winds, when present, led to a tilting of the updrafts and toroids. Patterns in the reflectivity and velocity fields indicated regions of major intrusions into the thermals, accompanied by entrainment of ambient air, or recycling of larger hydrometeors, depending on their location. In addition, at the upper cloud/enviromnent interface, instability nodes contributed to further entrapment of cloud-free air. The observations presented in this paper constitute clear demonstrations and quantitative characterization of vortical circulations in growing cumulus turrets; they should provide a more reliable basis for the assessment of simulations and of model parameterizations.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT The advancing front of a buoyant plume which is being established in uniform surroundings has some properties in common with the plume, while in other respects it behaves more like a {\&}lsquo;thermal{\&}rsquo; released from rest. The solutions for these two cases cannot be matched directly, since the dependence of velocity on height is different. It is shown here that a similarity solution, which is consistent with the equations describing both parts of the flow, can be obtained once it is recognized that the velocity of the front may be less than that of the steady plume. The cap moves with a constant fraction of the plume velocity at the same level, and the total buoyancy in the cap is increasing, so a modification of the simple relations for thermals is required.This prediction is verified experimentally, and numerical values for the ratio of the velocities and the rate of increase of the cap radius with height determined. The extreme front of plume cap advances at about 0{\&}middot;6 times the mean velocity on the axis of a steady plume, and it spreads at just over half the angle of a thermal. This implies a smaller rate of entrainment and therefore a smaller rate of dilution per unit height compared with a thermal, especially since about half of the fluid mixed into the cap comes from the plume below. The model allows one to estimate the time necessary for convection from a known steady source on the ground to lead to the formation of a cloud.},

abstract = {Lateral mixing parameters in buoyancy-driven deep convection schemes$\backslash$nare among the most sensitive and important unknowns in atmosphere$\backslash$nmodels. Unfortunately, there is not a true optimum value for plume$\backslash$nmixing rate, but rather a dilemma or tradeoff: Excessive dilution$\backslash$nof updrafts leads to unstable stratification bias in the mean state,$\backslash$nwhile inadequate dilution allows deep convection to occur too easily,$\backslash$ncausing poor space and time distributions and variability. In this$\backslash$ntoo-small parameter space, compromises are made based on competing$\backslash$nmetrics of model performance. We attempt to escape this �gentrainment$\backslash$ndilemma�h by making bulk plume parameters (chiefly entrainment rate)$\backslash$ndepend on a new prognostic variable (�gorganization,�h org) meant to$\backslash$nreflect the rectified effects of subgrid-scale structure in meteorological$\backslash$nfields. We test an org scheme in the Community Atmosphere Model (CAM5)$\backslash$nwith a new unified shallow-deep convection scheme (UW-ens, a 2-plume$\backslash$nversion of the University of Washington scheme). Since buoyant ascent$\backslash$ninvolves natural selection, subgrid structure makes convection systematically$\backslash$ndeeper and stronger than the pure unorganized case: plumes of average$\backslash$n(or randomly sampled) air rising in the average environment. To reflect$\backslash$nthis, org is nonnegative, but we leave it dimensionless. A time scale$\backslash$ncharacterizes its behavior (here -3 h for a 2o model). Currently$\backslash$nits source is rain evaporation, but other sources can be added easily.$\backslash$nWe also let org be horizontally transported by advection, as a mass-weighted$\backslash$nmean over the convecting layer. Linear coefficients link org to a$\backslash$nplume ensemble, which it assists via: 1) plume base warmth above$\backslash$nthe mean temperature 2) plume radius enhancement (reduced mixing),$\backslash$nand 3) increased probability of overlap in a multi-plume scheme,$\backslash$nwhere interactions benefit later generations (this part has only$\backslash$nbeen implemented in an offline toy column model). Since rain evaporation$\backslash$nis a source for org, it functions as a time-lagged but positive feedback$\backslash$non deep convection development. This evades the entrainment dilemma,$\backslash$nsince fully developed org-enhanced convection is not overly dilute,$\backslash$navoiding stability bias, while the pioneering updrafts of new convection$\backslash$nare suppressed by entrainment, encouraging more large-scale variability.},

abstract = {Most parameterizations for precipitating convec-tion in use today are bulk schemes, in which an ensemble of cumulus elements with different properties is modelled as a single, representative entraining-detraining plume. We re-view the underpinning mathematical model for such parame-terizations, in particular by comparing it with spectral models in which elements are not combined into the representative plume. The chief merit of a bulk model is that the representa-tive plume can be described by an equation set with the same structure as that which describes each element in a spectral model. The equivalence relies on an ansatz for detrained con-densate introduced by Yanai et al. (1973) and on a simplified microphysics. There are also conceptual differences in the closure of bulk and spectral parameterizations. In particu-lar, we show that the convective quasi-equilibrium closure of Arakawa and Schubert (1974) for spectral parameteriza-tions cannot be carried over to a bulk parameterization in a straightforward way. Quasi-equilibrium of the cloud work function assumes a timescale separation between a slow forc-ing process and a rapid convective response. But, for the natural bulk analogue to the cloud-work function, the rele-vant forcing is characterised by a different timescale, and so its quasi-equilibrium entails a different physical constraint. Closures of bulk parameterizations that use a parcel value of CAPE do not suffer from this timescale issue. However, the Yanai et al. (1973) ansatz must be invoked as a necessary ingredient of those closures.},

This study evaluates a series of indoleamine analogs as alternate substrates of AANAT. 3-Indolepropylamine and 3-indolebutylamine were chemically synthesized and found to be processed by AANAT, although 20- and 60-fold less efficiently compared with the natural substrate serotonin, respectively. Racemic alpha-methyltryptamine and Nomega-methyltryptamine were also shown to be substrates for AANAT, again with reduced kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin. The enzyme did exhibit approximately 9:1 stereoselectivity for the R-enantiomer of alpha-methyltryptamine versus the S-enantiomer. By measuring the enzymatic rates versus increasing buffer microviscosity, it was demonstrated that diffusional release of product is most likely the principal rate-determining step for the enzymatic transformation of tryptamine (which has similar kcat and kcat/Km compared with serotonin). Analysis of kcat and kcat/Km versus pH for the poor substrate Nomega-methyltryptamine showed that an ionizable group on the enzyme with pKa approximately 7, required to be in its deprotonated form, may be important in catalysis. The alpha-methyltryptamine analog alpha-trifluoromethyltryptamine was not processed by the enzyme, but served as a modest competitive inhibitor. Taken together with the pH-rate analysis, these results favor a model in which the serotonin substrate binds to the enzyme as the positively charged ammonium salt, and nucleophilicity of the amine is important in enzyme-catalyzed acetyl transfer.},

abstract = { ABSTRACT In this paper it is shown how earlier results for buoyant$\backslash$nvortex rings may be extended to describe the corresponding two-dimensional$\backslash$ncase, which arises in the theory of bent-over plumes. It is again$\backslash$nassumed that in uniform surroundings the circulation remains constant$\backslash$nwhile the buoyancy acts to increase the momentum of the pair. The$\backslash$nbehaviour in two dimensions is quite different from that in three,$\backslash$nhowever; a buoyant vortex ring spreads linearly with height, whereas$\backslash$na buoyant pair spreads exponentially with height, or linearly with$\backslash$ntime (and therefore, in a bent-over plume, linearly with distance$\backslash$ndownwind).The theory has been extended to describe the rise of buoyant$\backslash$nrings and pairs through stably stratified surroundings having a linear$\backslash$ndensity gradient. The behaviour near the maximum height reached is$\backslash$nfound to depend critically in both cases on the relative rates at$\backslash$nwhich the circulation and the momentum fall to zero. If these reach$\backslash$nzero together, the rings or pairs will steadily increase in size$\backslash$nand come to rest at a finite height and with a finite radius. If$\backslash$nthe circulation is non-zero when the momentum vanishes, the radius$\backslash$nbegins to decrease soon after the buoyancy becomes zero, and the$\backslash$nvortices will therefore tend to break up suddenly and mix into their$\backslash$nsurroundings. There is a considerable increase in the final height$\backslash$nwhich should be attained by vortex rings or bentover plumes if the$\backslash$ninitial circulation is increased; it is suggested that releasing$\backslash$nsmoke intermittently, rather than continuously, at high velocity$\backslash$nmight be a means of increasing the effective height of chimneys in$\backslash$ncalm conditions. When the circulation reaches zero before the momentum$\backslash$ndoes, the solutions indicate that the radius becomes very large near$\backslash$nthe level of zero buoyancy. },

abstract = { ABSTRACT The advancing front of a buoyant plume which is being established in uniform surroundings has some properties in common with the plume, while in other respects it behaves more like a {\&}lsquo;thermal{\&}rsquo; released from rest. The solutions for these two cases cannot be matched directly, since the dependence of velocity on height is different. It is shown here that a similarity solution, which is consistent with the equations describing both parts of the flow, can be obtained once it is recognized that the velocity of the front may be less than that of the steady plume. The cap moves with a constant fraction of the plume velocity at the same level, and the total buoyancy in the cap is increasing, so a modification of the simple relations for thermals is required.This prediction is verified experimentally, and numerical values for the ratio of the velocities and the rate of increase of the cap radius with height determined. The extreme front of plume cap advances at about 0{\&}middot;6 times the mean velocity on the axis of a steady plume, and it spreads at just over half the angle of a thermal. This implies a smaller rate of entrainment and therefore a smaller rate of dilution per unit height compared with a thermal, especially since about half of the fluid mixed into the cap comes from the plume below. The model allows one to estimate the time necessary for convection from a known steady source on the ground to lead to the formation of a cloud. },

abstract = {Analytical expressions for entrainment and detrainment are derived based on general total water specific humidity and mass budget equations. From these expressions, containing a small-scale turbulent and a larger-scale organized term, a physical picture emerges for a shallow cumulus cloud ensemble in which the individual clouds have a massive entrainment at the bottom, lateral turbulent mixing with constant mass flux between bottom and top, and massive detrainment at the top. Combining these results with the general budget equation for vertical velocity, new formulae for entrainment and detrainment rates can be expressed in terms of buoyancy, vertical velocity and cloud fraction. For a variety of shallow convection cases, results from large-eddy simulations show a good correspondence of these new formulae with more traditional methods to diagnose entrainment and detrainment rates. Moreover, the formulae give insight into the behaviour and the physical nature of the mixing coefficients. They explain the observed large variability of the detrainment. The formulae cannot be directly applied as a parametrization. However, it is demonstrated how they can be used to evaluate existing parametrization approaches and as a sound physical base for future parametrization developments.

abstract = {AbstractNew theoretical analytic expressions are derived for the evolution of a passive scalar, buoyancy, and vertical velocity in growing, entraining moist deep convective updrafts. These expressions are a function of updraft radius, height, convective available potential energy (CAPE), and environmental relative humidity RH. They are quantitatively consistent with idealized three-dimensional moist updraft simulations with varying updraft sizes and in environments with differing RH. In particular, the analytic expressions capture the rapid decrease of buoyancy with height due to entrainment for narrow updrafts in a dry environment despite large CAPE. In contrast to the standard entraining-plume model, the theoretical expressions also describe the effects of engulfment of environmental air between the level of free convection (LFC) and height of maximum buoyancy (HMB) required by mass continuity to balance upward acceleration of updraft air (i.e., dynamic entrainment). This organized inflow sharpens horizontal gradients, thereby enhancing smaller-scale lateral turbulent mixing below the HMB. For narrow updrafts in a dry environment, this enhanced mixing leads to a negatively buoyant region between the LFC and HMB, effectively cutting off the region of positive buoyancy at the HMB from below so that the updraft structure resembles a rising thermal rather than a plume. Thus, it is proposed that a transition from plume-like to thermal-like structure is driven by dynamic entrainment and depends on updraft width (relative to height) and environmental RH. These results help to bridge the entraining-plume and rising-thermal conceptual models of moist convection.},

These results are achieved by improving the parameterizations of the following physical processes: vertical mixing through the inclusion of an overturning thermal circulation near cloud top, lateral entrainment by modifying the assumed shape of the cloud, initiating convection with sustained boundary-layer forcing that resembles the lifting by gust fronts associated with tropical oceanic cumulonimbus, and making the pressure perturbation internally consistent with the horizontal distribution of vertical velocity in the cloud.

@misc{Balaji1988,
abstract = {Abstract Deep cumulus dynamics has often been treated as an initial value problem where the long time effect of surface energy fluxes are neglected. Initiation is often assumed to follow from a strong localized deformation of the flow field, which is elsewhere quiescent. In nature, however, the atmosphere is rarely found in an undisturbed condition just prior to the inception of deep growth. One likely cause of widespread motions is the natural modal response of the environment to surface energy fluxes which results in a field of disturbances. Evidence is presented in this paper for the possible existence of a class of solutions when deep convection is allowed to evolve in the context of a thermally forced field of shallow convection. This class of solutions is neglected when one visualizes the growth of severe local storms in term of buoyant bubbles in an otherwise tranquil atmosphere. Considering deep cumulus initiation as a field problem severely limits the concept of an isolated cloud. Individual clouds may owe much of their structure to the existence of, and interaction with, the field of thermally forced deep normal modes. The importance of the local forcing terms is demonstrated here through a numerical simulation of the evolution of deep and severe convection out of a locally forced shallow cloud field in the absence of large scale forcing. When convection is initiated over the entire domain locally through thermal forcing at the ground, the modal solution first observed corresponds to the Rayleigh solution which consist of modes confined to the boundary-layer. However, solutions in the deep linear equations show that a second modal solution also exists. The dominance of this solution, which consists of deep modes of longer horizontal wavelength, is shown here to lead to deep convection. While the contribution of local forcing terms to the overall energy budget may be negligible at the severe convective stage, the mechanism of initiation appears to influence the pattern of evolution even into the mature stage. At the stage of shallow cumulus, the well-known phenomenon of upshear cumulus development is observed. As clouds grow deeper, an interesting phenomenon of phase-decoupled modal solutions is observed:. the growth of clouds appears to decouple the boundary-layer horizontal motions in phase from the stable layer motions, an effect that cyclically enhances and suppresses cloud growth. A characteristic time may be computed, and average cloud longevity inferred. Finally; the interaction of a moving storm system in its severe stage with the boundary-layer modes appears to provide one explanation for the spatial and temporal distribution of new convective cells in a multicellular storm system.},

abstract = {Greenhouse gases such as carbon dioxide (CO2 ) absorb heat (infrared radiation) emitted from Earth's surface. Increases in the atmospheric concentrations of these gases cause Earth to warm by trapping more of this heat. Human activities—especially the burning of fossil fuels since the start of the Industrial Revolution—have increased atmospheric CO2 concentrations by about 40{\%}, with more than half the increase occurring since 1970. Since 1900, the global average surface temperature has increased by about 0.8 °C (1.4 °F). This has been accompanied by warming of the ocean, a rise in sea level, a strong decline in Arctic sea ice, and many other associated climate effects. Much of this warming has occurred in the last four decades. Detailed analyses have shown that the warming during this period is mainly a result of the increased concentrations of CO2 and other greenhouse gases. Continued emissions of these gases will cause further climate change, including substantial increases in global average surface temperature and important changes in regional climate. The magnitude and timing of these changes will depend on many factors, and slowdowns and accelerations in warming lasting a decade or more will continue to occur. However, long-term climate change over many decades will depend mainly on the total amount of CO2 and other greenhouse gases emitted as a result of human activities.},

abstract = {This research develops simple diagnostic expressions for vertical acceleration dw/dt and vertical velocity w within updrafts that account for effective buoyancy and the dynamic pressure gradient force. Effective buoyancy is the statically forced component of the vertical gradient in the nonhydrostatic pressure field. The diagnostic expressions derived herein show that the effective buoyancy of an updraft is dependent on the magnitude of the temperature perturbation within an updraft relative to the air along the updraft's immediate periphery du 0 y (rather than relative to an arbitrary base state as in u 0 y), the updraft's height-to-width aspect ratio, and the updraft's slant relative to the vertical. The diagnostic expressions are significantly improved over parcel theory (where pressure forces are ig-nored) in their portrayal of the vertical profile of w through updrafts from a cloud model simulation and accurately diagnosed the maximum vertical velocity w max within updrafts. The largest improvements to the diagnostic expressions over parcel theory resulted from their dependence on du 0 y rather than u 0 y . Whereas the actual w max within simulated updrafts was located approximately two-thirds to three-fourths of the distance between the updraft base and the updraft top, w max within profiles diagnosed by expressions was portrayed at the updraft top when the dynamic pressure force was ignored. A rudimentary theoretical representation of the dynamic pressure force in the diagnostic expressions improved their portrayal of the simulated w profile. These results augment the conceptual understanding of convective updrafts and provide avenues for im-proving the representation of vertical mass flux in cumulus parameterizations.},

abstract = {The slowdown in the rate of global warming in the early 2000s is not evident in the multi-model ensemble average of traditional climate change projection simulations. However, a number of individual ensemble members from that set of models successfully simulate the early-2000s hiatus when naturally-occurring climate variability involving the Interdecadal Pacific Oscillation (IPO) coincided, by chance, with the observed negative phase of the IPO that contributed to the early-2000s hiatus. If the recent methodology of initialized decadal climate prediction could have been applied in the mid-1990s using the Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 5 multi-models, both the negative phase of the IPO in the early 2000s as well as the hiatus could have been simulated, with the multi-model average performing better than most of the individual models. The loss of predictive skill for six initial years before the mid-1990s points to the need for consistent hindcast skill to establish reliability of an operational decadal climate prediction system.},

abstract = {Cloud physics has grown up with concentrated efforts focused on compartmentalized topics in the subject, where researchers have studied specific problems with little regard to other areas. The developing understanding of turbulent entrainment and the understanding that turbulence is best described in the atmosphere by circulating self-contained entities, which are often buoyant and carry fluid from one level to another, has led to a unifying picture of clouds wherein all clouds and convective processes can be seen as one phenomenon in which various conditions decide the final form. The microphysical processes are described and the controlling effects of entity type entrainment mixing are shown to provide an explanation for many of the observations. The inadequacy of most computer calculations in providing viable models is pointed out. The need for self-consistent conceptual structures as a basis for adequate models is stressed. Improved instruments for remote sensing and aircraft measurements, along with the present conceptual developments and computational capabilities, suggest that adequate models of clouds may be soon developed.},

abstract = {Large-eddy simulation is used to study the sensitivity of trade wind cumulus clouds to pertur-bations in cloud droplet number concentrations. We find that the trade wind cumulus system approaches a radiative-convective equilibrium state, modified by net warming and drying from imposed large-scale advective forcing. The system requires several days to reach equilibrium when cooling rates are specified but much less time, and with less sensitivity to cloud droplet number density, when radiation depends real-istically on the vertical distribution of water vapor. The transient behavior and the properties of the near-equilibrium cloud field depend on the microphysical state and therefore on the cloud droplet number den-sity, here taken as a proxy for the ambient aerosol. The primary response of the cloud field to changes in the cloud droplet number density is deepening of the cloud layer. This deepening leads to a decrease in rel-ative humidity and a faster evaporation of small clouds and cloud remnants constituting a negative lifetime effect. In the near-equilibrium regime, the decrease in cloud cover compensates much of the Twomey effect, i.e., the brightening of the clouds, and the overall aerosol effect on the albedo of the organized pre-cipitating cumulus cloud field is small.},

abstract = {In this paper, we use a dry radiative-transportive climate model to illustrate that the atmospheric poleward heat transport plays an important role in amplifying the polar surface warming due to anthropogenic greenhouse gases. Because of a much warmer surface in tropics, the anthropogenic radiative forcing is larger in tropics than in extratropics for same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. A direct response to the anthropogenic radiative forcing is an increase in the atmosphere equator-to-pole temperature contrast, leading to a strengthening of the atmospheric poleward heat transport. As a result, part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the low-latitude atmosphere due to an increase in its opacity is transported to high latitudes. This implies a greenhouse-plus (greenhouse-minus) feedback to the high (low) latitude surface temperatures, which acts to amplify (reduce) the initial surface warming in high (low) latitudes and may cause a larger surface warming in high latitudes. The StefanBoltzmann feedback suppresses the negative dynamical feedback in low latitudes more strongly than the positive in high latitudes, amplifying the global mean surface temperature warming. Because of the oceanic poleward heat transport, the ocean surface temperature in extratropics is warmer in winter compared to the land, implying a larger radiative forcing for the same amount of anthropogenic greenhouse gases. The same dynamical feedback mechanism would also amplify the land surface warming in extratropics by transporting part of the extra amount of energy intercepted by the atmosphere over the ocean surface to land. This explains partly why the observed land surface warming in extratropics is stronger than the surrounding oceans in winter. Contact Information Ming Cai},

abstract = {A line-by-line model (LBLRTM) has been applied to the calculation of clear-sky longwave fluxes and cooling rates for atmospheres including CO2, 03, CH4, N20, CC14, CFC-11, CFC-12, and CFC-22 in addition to water vapor. The present paper continues the approach developed in an earlier article in which the radiative properties of atmospheres with water vapor alone were reported. Tropospheric water vapor continues to be of principal importance for the longwave region due to the spectral extent of its absorbing properties, while the absorption bands of other trace species have influence over limited spectral domains. The principal effects of adding carbon dioxide are to reduce the role of the water vapor in the lower troposphere and to provide 72{\%} of the 13.0 K d - • cooling rate at the stratopause. In general, the introduction of uniformly mixed trace species into atmospheres with significant amounts of water vapor has the effect of reducing the cooling associated with water vapor, providing an apparent net atmospheric heating. The radiative consequences of doubling carbon dioxide from the present level are consistent with these results. For the midlatitude summer atmosphere the heating associated with ozone that occurs from 500 to 20 mbar reaches a maximum of 0.25 K d - • at 50 mbar and partially offsets the cooling of 1.0 K d - • contributed by H20 and CO2 at this level. In the stratosphere the 704 cm - • band of ozone, not included in many radiation models, contributes 25{\%} of the ozone cooling rate. Radiative effects associated with anticipated 10-year constituent profile changes, 1990-2000, are presented from both a spectral and spectrally integrated perspective. The effect of the trace gases has been studied for three atmospheres: tropical, midlatitude summer, and midlatitude winter. Using these results and making a reasonable approximation for the polar regions, we obtain a value for the longwave flux at the top of the atmosphere of 265.5 W m -2, in close agreement with the clear-sky Earth Radiation Budget Experiment (ERBE) observations. This agreement provides strong support for the present approach as a reference method for the study of radiative effects resulting from changes in the distributions of trace species on global radiative forcing. Many of the results from the spectral calculations reported here are archived at the Carbon Dioxide Information and Analysis Center for use by the community.},

Here, the exact, explicit, analytic expression is derived for an air parcel's LCL as a function of its temperature and relative humidity. Unlike previous analytic expressions, some of which can have errors as high as hundreds or thousands of meters, this exact expression is accurate to within the uncertainty of empirical vapor-pressure measurements: this translates into an uncertainty of around five meters for all temperatures and relative humidities. An exact, explicit, analytic expression for the lifting deposition level (LDL) is also derived, and its behavior is compared to the LCL. At sufficiently cold temperatures, aerosols freeze homogeneously below the LCL; an approximate, implicit, analytic expression is given for this lifting freezing level (LFL).

abstract = {This paper examines several prominent thermodynamic and dynamic factors responsible for the meridional and vertical warming asymmetries using a moist coupled atmosphere–surface radiative transportive four-box climate model. A coupled atmosphere–surface feedback analysis is formulated to isolate the direct response to an anthropogenic greenhouse gas forcing from individual local feedbacks (water vapor, evaporation, surface sensible heat flux, and ice-albedo), and from the non-local dynamical feedback. Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback are stronger in low latitudes. The joint effect of the ice-albedo and dynamical greenhouse-plus feedbacks acts to amplify the high latitude surface warming whereas both the evaporation and dynamical greenhouse-minus feedbacks cause a reduction of the surface warming in low latitudes. The enhancement (reduction) of local feedbacks in high (low) latitudes in response to the non-local dynamic feedback further strengthens the polar amplification of the surface warming. Both the direct response and response to water vapor feedback lead to an increase of lapse rate in both low and high latitudes. The stronger total dynamic heating in the mean state in high latitudes is responsible for a larger increase of lapse rate in high latitudes in the direct response and response to water vapor feedback. The local evaporation and surface sensible heat flux feedbacks reduce the lapse rate both in low and high latitudes through cooling the surface and warming the atmosphere. The much stronger evaporation feedback leads to a final warming in low latitudes that is stronger in the atmosphere than the surface.},

The height of ascent and the growth of thermal together with its mean velocity variations are found to be highly dependent on its initial momentum and buoyancy. The stratification introduces an entrainment dependent on the shape and size of the thermal, ambient density gradients and the mean velocity of ascent of the thermal. With increasing weak linear stratification, the movement of the thermal is damped and the thermal growth and its height of ascent is retarded at large times. {\textcopyright} 1973.},

The new climate feedback analysis method formulated in Lu and Cai (Clim Dyn 32:873-885, 2009) is used to isolate contributions from both radiative and non-radiative feedback processes to the total temperature change obtained with the coupled GCM. These partial temperature changes are additive and their sum is convergent to the total temperature change. The radiative energy flux perturbations due to the doubling of CO2 and water vapor feedback lead to a stronger warming in low latitudes than in high latitudes at the surface and throughout the entire troposphere. In the vertical, the temperature changes due to the doubling of CO2 and water vapor feedback are maximum near the surface and decrease with height at all latitudes. The simultaneous warming reduction in low latitudes and amplification in high latitudes by the enhanced poleward dry static energy transport reverses the poleward decreasing warming pattern at the surface and in the lower troposphere, but it is not able to do so in the upper troposphere. The enhanced vertical moist convection in the tropics acts to amplify the warming in the upper troposphere at an expense of reducing the warming in the lower troposphere and surface warming in the tropics. As a result, the final warming pattern shows the co-existence of a reduction of the meridional temperature gradient at the surface and in the lower troposphere with an increase of the meridional temperature gradient in the upper troposphere. In the tropics, the total warming in the upper troposphere is stronger than the surface warming.},

abstract = {Miscible thermals are formed by instantaneously releasing a finite volume of buoyant fluid into stagnant ambient. Their subsequent motion is then driven by the buoyancy convection. The gross characteristics (e.g. overall size and velocity) of a thermal have been well studied and reported to be self-similar. However, there have been few studies concerning the internal structure. Here, turbulent miscible thermals (with initial density excess of 5 {\%} and Reynolds number around 2100) have been investigated experimentally through a large number of realizations. The vorticity and density fields were quantified separately by particle image velocimetry (PIV) and planar laser-induced fluorescence (PLIF) techniques. Ensemble-averaged data of the transient development of the miscible thermals are presented. Major outcomes include: (i) validating Turner's assumption of constant circulation within a buoyant vortex ring; (ii) measuring the vorticity and density distributions within the miscible thermal; (iii) quantifying the effect of baroclinicity on the generation and destruction of vorticity within the thermal; and (iv) identifying the significantly slower decay rate of the peak density as compared to the mean. {\textcopyright} 2013 Cambridge University Press.},
